00:00:00 - 00:00:05  |    What do you think about the match against France?
00:00:05 - 00:00:07  |    Good evening.
00:00:07 - 00:00:12  |    We can easily imagine your disappointment.
00:00:12 - 00:00:15  |    Is there still room for pride?
00:00:15 - 00:00:18  |    Of course, very sad.
00:00:18 - 00:00:20  |    We are competitors.
00:00:20 - 00:00:24  |    The only thing that makes us really happy is victory.
00:00:24 - 00:00:27  |    Now very proud, very proud of what we did.
00:00:27 - 00:00:31  |    Very proud of the heart of this team.
00:00:31 - 00:00:35  |    We managed to get millions of French to live.
00:00:35 - 00:00:38  |    Millions of fans around the world.
00:00:38 - 00:00:40  |    We had a lot of obstacles in this competition.
00:00:40 - 00:00:42  |    We didn't give up.
00:00:42 - 00:00:46  |    We ended up emptying, but we gave everything on the field.
00:00:46 - 00:00:51  |    And even when we were not good, even when we were at the bottom of the hole for an hour during this match,
00:00:51 - 00:00:52  |    we didn't give up.
00:00:52 - 00:00:55  |    We managed to come back and we could even have won.
00:00:55 - 00:00:58  |    There is still a lot of pride.
00:00:58 - 00:01:02  |    In the end, it's pretty cruel, but it's football.
00:01:02 - 00:01:06  |    I think Argentina deserved to win this match.
00:01:06 - 00:01:08  |    That's how it is.
00:01:08 - 00:01:32  |    In any case, sad, but proud.
00:01:38 - 00:01:40  |    I am very proud.
00:01:40 - 00:01:44  |    We have welcomed everyone here in the Arab world.
00:01:44 - 00:01:50  |    The world has known our culture, our history and our welcome.
00:01:50 - 00:01:55  |    We are allowed, but the goals are always a lottery.
00:01:55 - 00:02:05  |    But frankly, given the quality of the match, the defeat is not illogical.
00:02:05 - 00:02:07  |    It hurts.
00:02:07 - 00:02:10  |    We are happy not to be left behind.
00:02:10 - 00:02:16  |    We were at the end of 70 minutes because losing like that would have been very difficult.
00:02:16 - 00:02:19  |    In the penalty shoot-out, we could have been more unhappy.
00:02:19 - 00:02:21  |    We went to that.
00:02:21 - 00:02:22  |    To go to the end.
00:02:22 - 00:02:23  |    The issue is not good.
00:02:23 - 00:02:26  |    I'm happy to go back with the Trollopus.
00:02:26 - 00:02:30  |    It's really an exceptional final.
00:02:30 - 00:02:32  |    We believed until the end.
00:02:32 - 00:02:34  |    In any case, we are proud of the Blues.
00:02:34 - 00:02:37  |    I think like all the French.
00:02:37 - 00:02:41  |    It's the game.
00:02:41 - 00:02:43  |    As a supporter, it was the most beautiful of the finals.
00:02:43 - 00:02:46  |    But it ends cruelly.
00:02:46 - 00:02:52  |    In any case, congratulations to Didier Deschamps who did with his effective
00:02:52 - 00:02:55  |    and so much absence something great.
00:02:55 - 00:02:59  |    Shoot in France disappointed, but with lots of stars in his eyes.
00:02:59 - 00:03:00  |    That's the important thing.
00:03:00 - 00:03:03  |    These are huge memories.
00:03:03 - 00:03:05  |    The bounce, so much emotion.
00:03:05 - 00:03:06  |    Everyone was crying.
00:03:06 - 00:03:07  |    Everyone was screaming.
00:03:07 - 00:03:13  |    There were 90% Argentinians, but at the end, we said to ourselves that it was incredible.
00:03:13 - 00:03:42  |    One of the most beautiful games of the season, I think.
00:03:42 - 00:03:44  |    Go, Blues!
00:03:44 - 00:03:46  |    Go, Blues!
00:03:46 - 00:04:13  |    Go, Blues!

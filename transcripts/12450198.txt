00:12:00 - 00:12:04  |    We have created a whole plan of cooperation along the government line.
00:12:04 - 00:12:12  |    Until 2030, a large number of joint projects are scheduled to be implemented.
00:12:12 - 00:12:20  |    We have a great opportunity to analyze everything that has been done in recent times,
00:12:20 - 00:12:26  |    what should have been done in the current difficult conditions.
00:12:26 - 00:12:29  |    In fact, they have probably never been simple.
00:12:29 - 00:12:42  |    You know that the Soviet Union and Russia have always supported and continue to support the Cuban people in their struggle for independence and sovereignty.
00:12:42 - 00:12:48  |    We have always stood up to various restrictions, embargoes, blockades, and so on.
00:12:48 - 00:12:52  |    We have always supported Cuba on international grounds.
00:12:52 - 00:12:59  |    And we see that Cuba is taking the same position towards our country and towards Russia.
00:12:59 - 00:13:09  |    All this is the result of the traditional friendship that was laid out by Comrade Fidel Castro.
00:13:09 - 00:13:12  |    Today we have opened his monument.
00:13:12 - 00:13:19  |    In my opinion, the monument is very good. I do not know whether you liked it or not, but it seems to me that you may not like it.
00:13:19 - 00:13:40  |    Indeed, this is a good memory of him, a real work of art, dynamic, moving, moving forward, and the image of a fighter, of course, is created.
00:13:40 - 00:13:50  |    I really remember our personal meetings with him.

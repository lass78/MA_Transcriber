01:27:30 - 01:27:36  |    with an open word about the restoration of the Lenin principle of national self-determination.
01:27:36 - 01:27:41  |    Moreover, in the course of the fight for power within the Communist Party itself,
01:27:41 - 01:27:45  |    each of the opposing parties, in order to expand its support base,
01:27:45 - 01:27:50  |    began to senselessly encourage and encourage nationalist moods,
01:27:50 - 01:27:56  |    to play on them, promising their potential supporters everything they would wish for.
01:27:56 - 01:28:05  |    In the face of superficial and populist talk about democracy and a bright future built on the basis of either market or planned economy,
01:28:05 - 01:28:09  |    but in the context of real embezzlement of people and a total deficit,
01:28:09 - 01:28:16  |    no one from the authorities and did not think about inevitable, tragic consequences for the country.
01:28:16 - 01:28:26  |    And then we went all the way to the dawn of the creation of the USSR as a path to the satisfaction of the ambitions of the nationalist elites grown up in their own party ranks.
01:28:26 - 01:28:34  |    Let me remind you that the CPSU no longer has, and thank God, no more tools to hold power,
01:28:34 - 01:28:39  |    and the country itself, as a state terror, is a dictatorship of the Stalinist type.
01:28:39 - 01:28:48  |    And that even the notorious leading role of the party, like the morning fog, disappears without a trace right in front of their eyes.
01:28:48 - 01:28:55  |    In September 1989, a so-called national party policy in modern conditions, the CPSU platform,
01:28:55 - 01:29:02  |    which was adopted by the CPSU Central Committee of the Communist Party, was taken over by the CPSU.
01:29:02 - 01:29:06  |    It contained the following position, I quote,
01:29:06 - 01:29:14  |    The CPSU has all the rights pertaining to its status as a sovereign socialist state.
01:29:14 - 01:29:16  |    One more point.
01:29:16 - 01:29:27  |    The highest representatives of the authorities of the CPSU can protest and stop the actions of the CPSU's decisions and orders in their territory.
01:29:27 - 01:29:38  |    And finally, every allied republic has its own citizenship, which is distributed to all its inhabitants.
01:29:38 - 01:29:43  |    Wasn't it obvious what such statements and decisions would lead to?
01:29:43 - 01:29:51  |    Now is not the time, not the place to get into the question of state or constitutional rights, to make the definition of citizenship itself,
01:29:51 - 01:30:01  |    but the question still arises, why was it necessary in those and without those difficult conditions to shake up the country even more?
01:30:01 - 01:30:03  |    The fact remains a fact.
01:30:03 - 01:30:09  |    Two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was in fact predetermined.
01:30:09 - 01:30:18  |    Now, radicals and nationalists, including, above all, in Ukraine, assign themselves the merit of conquering independence.
01:30:18 - 01:30:20  |    As we can see, this is not the case.
01:30:20 - 01:30:30  |    The historical and strategic mistakes of the leaders of the Bolsheviks and the leadership of the CPSU have led to the collapse of our united country.

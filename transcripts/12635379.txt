00:00:00 - 00:00:04  |    This is my name, it's her name.
00:00:14 - 00:00:18  |    But I can hide it, we don't have to for now.
00:00:18 - 00:00:29  |    I don't know if I can answer the question.
00:00:29 - 00:00:31  |    Can you see them both?
00:00:31 - 00:00:51  |    One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
00:00:51 - 00:00:53  |    So nice to meet you, Aswala.
00:00:53 - 00:00:55  |    Thank you very much.
00:00:55 - 00:00:57  |    Likewise.
00:00:57 - 00:01:11  |    We are very excited to hear why it was so important for you to have a friendship with people from Denmark in the 90s.
00:01:27 - 00:01:44  |    I never thought about it, but it made me happy to have a contact with other nations, with people.
00:01:57 - 00:02:03  |    Excuse me, Marcin, is it still on?
00:02:03 - 00:02:05  |    It should be on.
00:02:05 - 00:02:08  |    I don't know where it is, but it is on.
00:02:08 - 00:02:14  |    Thank you.
00:02:14 - 00:02:16  |    Do you want to say something?
00:02:16 - 00:02:20  |    Yes, please.
00:02:20 - 00:02:31  |    How did the friendship between you and the Danish city start?
00:02:31 - 00:02:39  |    How did the friendship between you and the Danish city start?
00:02:39 - 00:03:07  |    One day, our then mayor, knowing that I am an instructor of the police, called me and asked if I would like to have a contact with the Danes who are willing to cooperate with us.
00:03:09 - 00:03:36  |    Our then mayor called me, knowing that I am an instructor of the police, called me and asked if I would like to have a contact with the Danes who are willing to cooperate with us.
00:03:36 - 00:03:43  |    And then what happened? Who do you contact and how does it start?
00:03:43 - 00:03:48  |    What happened then? Who did you contact and how did it all start?
00:03:48 - 00:03:52  |    I expressed my consent to this contact.
00:03:52 - 00:03:59  |    Our then mayor, Bogdan Łapa, also knew that I knew the German contact.
00:03:59 - 00:04:04  |    And he immediately gave me the phone number to Bente Berre.
00:04:04 - 00:04:08  |    So I agreed to connect with the Danish people.
00:04:08 - 00:04:13  |    And also the mayor, Bogdan Łapa, he knew that I speak a bit of German.
00:04:13 - 00:04:18  |    And he gave me a phone number to this woman called Bente Berre.
00:04:18 - 00:04:20  |    OK. Bente.
00:04:20 - 00:04:24  |    Bente.
00:04:24 - 00:04:26  |    And what happened?
00:04:26 - 00:04:40  |    And after a few weeks, a three-person delegation from Vordenburg, Bente, Nils and Vigo came to us.
00:04:40 - 00:04:42  |    Bente, Nils and Vigo.
00:04:42 - 00:04:51  |    So a couple of weeks later, the three-person delegation came to us and it was Bente, Nils and Vigo here in Tuzikowo.
00:04:51 - 00:04:53  |    OK.
00:04:53 - 00:04:55  |    It was 1991.
00:04:55 - 00:04:58  |    It was 1991.
00:04:58 - 00:05:02  |    Just a moment.
00:05:02 - 00:05:04  |    1999.
00:05:04 - 00:05:06  |    1991.
00:05:06 - 00:05:08  |    OK.
00:05:08 - 00:05:23  |    So we keep going where we left.
00:05:23 - 00:05:25  |    Yes.
00:05:25 - 00:05:27  |    Delegation.
00:05:27 - 00:05:31  |    Yes.
00:05:31 - 00:05:36  |    So the delegation from Denmark, they came here to visit.
00:05:36 - 00:05:39  |    And how was that visit?
00:05:39 - 00:05:42  |    What was their first visit? What happened then?
00:05:42 - 00:05:48  |    Well, they wanted to get to know us, first of all, what kind of people we are.
00:05:48 - 00:05:56  |    It was very official. All three of us lived in the boarding school, because then the middle school had a boarding school.
00:05:56 - 00:06:00  |    Everyone got their own room.
00:06:00 - 00:06:06  |    We took them to our home for meals.
00:06:06 - 00:06:09  |    And there were meetings.
00:06:09 - 00:06:18  |    And in Ratusz, with the mayor, if we imagined this further cooperation, if we wanted it at all.
00:06:18 - 00:06:24  |    And the decision fell, and it slowly started.
00:06:24 - 00:06:28  |    So the first visit was very official.
00:06:28 - 00:06:33  |    So they got their rooms in a school hostel.
00:06:33 - 00:06:41  |    And we were driving them to the local restaurants for dinners, and there were several meetings, mostly in the town hall.
00:06:41 - 00:06:43  |    So it was official.
00:06:43 - 00:06:51  |    And we were discussing how our cooperation should look like, and if we even want to cooperate, to start cooperating.
00:06:51 - 00:06:56  |    But the decision was made that, yes, we want to continue.
00:06:56 - 00:07:01  |    What made you choose to have that cooperation?
00:07:01 - 00:07:05  |    What was the reason that you thought, this is a good idea, we should do this?
00:07:05 - 00:07:08  |    Marcin, can I ask you one thing?
00:07:08 - 00:07:13  |    When she replies, it would be very helpful if she speaks to them, even though they don't understand.
00:07:13 - 00:07:18  |    Yes, I would like to talk to my colleague all the time.
00:07:18 - 00:07:28  |    What made you, but also you, feel that this cooperation is worth mentioning?
00:07:28 - 00:07:33  |    I immediately felt sympathy for Bente.
00:07:33 - 00:07:36  |    Ad hoc.
00:07:36 - 00:07:46  |    And we decided to start working together to change the youth, to change the youth groups.
00:07:46 - 00:07:50  |    I immediately felt the connection with Bente.
00:07:50 - 00:07:53  |    So it was a very strong feeling.
00:07:53 - 00:08:03  |    And we decided that we would start the cooperation with, like, exchange trips of young people.
00:08:03 - 00:08:15  |    And I was wondering, in 1991, it's just after the Cold War ending and the ending of the Soviet Union.
00:08:15 - 00:08:27  |    Was it kind of a new thing with the cooperation between the scouts or cities, between Poland and Denmark?
00:08:27 - 00:08:38  |    I wonder, because 1991 is a moment in Polish history when communism ended, the Cold War ended, the Soviet Union fell apart.
00:08:38 - 00:08:42  |    Was this cooperation with Western countries something new?
00:08:42 - 00:08:55  |    No, not for me. For me, it was nothing new, because in 1988 I started the exchange with the scouts in Bremen, Germany.
00:08:55 - 00:09:01  |    In 1987, earlier, with Finland, Turkey.
00:09:01 - 00:09:09  |    And it was basically the third exchange. And I knew I could handle it.
00:09:09 - 00:09:22  |    Well, for me, not really, because before that, I made such exchanges, such connections with Bremen in Germany and with Finnish towns.
00:09:22 - 00:09:28  |    And it was in the 80s. So for me, that was the third one, actually.
00:09:28 - 00:09:35  |    So, Ursula, you were the right person to do this. You were the expert that made it all happen.
00:09:35 - 00:09:42  |    So, in fact, you were the right person to deal with such contacts, because you already had experience.
00:09:42 - 00:09:47  |    I think so, yes, I think so.
00:09:47 - 00:09:50  |    Yes, I think so.
00:09:50 - 00:09:57  |    Can you tell us a bit about what did you do on the trips in Denmark?
00:09:57 - 00:10:03  |    Can you tell us how your visits in Denmark looked like?
00:10:03 - 00:10:14  |    First of all, I went with two friends, one disabled, Ewa, and Irena, who lives on the other side of the street.
00:10:14 - 00:10:27  |    We went and participated in their smaller events, the brotherhood of St. Jerzy.
00:10:27 - 00:10:35  |    By the way, we visited, and from then on we started a system that we lived privately.
00:10:35 - 00:10:41  |    From that moment on, we never went to the bursary, only privately.
00:10:41 - 00:10:43  |    What year was it?
00:10:43 - 00:10:58  |    1992.
00:11:13 - 00:11:21  |    We went to some celebrations made by the St. George Society.
00:11:21 - 00:11:34  |    Where in Denmark did you live with people privately? In which cities in Denmark?
00:11:34 - 00:11:43  |    I don't remember the name of the place where you lived.
00:11:43 - 00:11:49  |    In Vordenborg. We have already started cooperation with people from Vordenborg.
00:11:49 - 00:11:59  |    I lived in Bente, someone lived in Nilsa, and there is a larger group of people who took care of us.
00:11:59 - 00:12:04  |    By the way, more and more of us came from our Polish side.
00:12:04 - 00:12:09  |    So from the very beginning, this cooperation was with Vordenborg.
00:12:09 - 00:12:17  |    I stayed with Bente, some people stayed with Nils in his house, but also there were more hosts,
00:12:17 - 00:12:21  |    and there were more and more people coming from Poland as well.
00:12:21 - 00:12:29  |    Should we start asking about this?
00:12:29 - 00:12:33  |    Can you ask why it was important to have this friendship?
00:12:33 - 00:12:54  |    I will just call back, sorry, because someone is trying to contact me, so one minute.
00:12:54 - 00:12:56  |    Are you good?
00:12:56 - 00:13:08  |    Why was this cooperation important to you?
00:13:08 - 00:13:26  |    I didn't think about it at the time, because after the various transformations, we lost contact.
00:13:26 - 00:13:33  |    For us it was something nice, which enriched us as well. We learned.
00:13:33 - 00:13:42  |    So I didn't think about it at the time, but after this difficult time of transformation, of political changes,
00:13:42 - 00:13:51  |    we were very eager to learn the world and to meet new people, so it was very enriching for us, this experience.
00:13:51 - 00:13:54  |    Did it make sense?
00:13:54 - 00:13:59  |    Did you become real friends with the people you visited in Denmark?
00:13:59 - 00:14:03  |    Can you say that you became friends with these people?
00:14:03 - 00:14:08  |    I definitely became friends with Bente, and with the other people it was an excuse,
00:14:08 - 00:14:13  |    because I really wanted the families to cooperate with each other,
00:14:13 - 00:14:18  |    so that it wasn't only official, but when they came to us,
00:14:18 - 00:14:27  |    so that we could also accept them as family, because we were always warmly welcomed there.
00:14:27 - 00:14:33  |    Yes, so with Bente I became very close friends, and it was very important from the beginning for me
00:14:33 - 00:14:38  |    to connect the Polish and Danish families.
00:14:38 - 00:14:43  |    They hosted us, and they always welcomed us very warmly,
00:14:43 - 00:14:48  |    and it was important for me to make the same here in Poland.
00:14:48 - 00:14:55  |    So it was not only about some cultural or political exchange, but for people to meet.
00:14:55 - 00:15:05  |    Can you tell us a bit about the differences or the similarities that you met in Denmark against Poland?
00:15:05 - 00:15:12  |    Can you say something about the cultural differences between Poland and Denmark at that time?
00:15:12 - 00:15:17  |    I didn't feel it that way, because I had already been to the West,
00:15:17 - 00:15:21  |    but for many families it was a surprise.
00:15:21 - 00:15:33  |    For example, another step, in 1993 we took a group of young scouts from Denmark,
00:15:33 - 00:15:44  |    and we were surprised when they came to us with backpacks full of food,
00:15:44 - 00:15:49  |    because they knew nothing about us, or almost nothing.
00:15:49 - 00:15:58  |    For me, in the 80s I traveled to Western Europe, so I was used to it,
00:15:58 - 00:16:05  |    but maybe the difference was that when in 1993 the group of scouts came from Denmark,
00:16:05 - 00:16:13  |    they had backpacks full of food, because they didn't know what to expect in Poland.
00:16:13 - 00:16:23  |    And I know that at the beginning my parents called me every day in fear that I didn't know what to do.
00:16:23 - 00:16:31  |    And the parents were calling them every day because they were so worried about their kids.
00:16:31 - 00:16:36  |    And how did that make you feel?
00:16:36 - 00:16:43  |    I assumed that it could happen, it wasn't a surprise for me,
00:16:43 - 00:16:52  |    and I calmed them down in some way, especially since we were going from Żukow to Bieszczady,
00:16:52 - 00:16:59  |    to our low mountains for two weeks, with a group of Polish people.
00:16:59 - 00:17:03  |    And that's how I wanted these children to become friends.
00:17:03 - 00:17:10  |    It didn't surprise me, I tried to calm those parents down,
00:17:10 - 00:17:15  |    because by then we made a trip to Bieszczady, which is on the opposite side of Poland,
00:17:15 - 00:17:19  |    next to the Ukrainian border, it's pretty wild mountains.
00:17:19 - 00:17:23  |    But I wanted to make those kids feel comfortable, because they were with Polish kids,
00:17:23 - 00:17:29  |    I wanted them to have fun together.
00:17:29 - 00:17:33  |    Jakub, should we start?
00:17:33 - 00:17:37  |    I think it's interesting, and she says that it's the first time you think about how important it was.
00:17:37 - 00:17:41  |    But three years ago, there was the Cold War.
00:17:41 - 00:17:45  |    So it must have been, regardless of whether it had been otherwise in China,
00:17:45 - 00:17:49  |    but it comes right after the Cold War, it must have been important to buy a bomb.
00:17:49 - 00:18:00  |    Yes.
00:18:00 - 00:18:07  |    You told us before that looking back, you realize now that it was important to do,
00:18:07 - 00:18:11  |    and to have these conversations with people from Denmark.
00:18:11 - 00:18:32  |    But also, when we look back on the history, only three years before, it was an entirely different...
00:18:32 - 00:18:38  |    You told us before that looking back, you realized that it was important
00:18:38 - 00:18:44  |    to do, and to have these conversations with people from Denmark.
00:18:44 - 00:18:51  |    But when we look at the history of Poland, we realize that only three years before,
00:18:51 - 00:18:55  |    the situation was entirely different.
00:18:55 - 00:19:04  |    How did you feel that difference from before the Warsaw Pact was ended?
00:19:04 - 00:19:09  |    You mentioned that at that time you had lost contact with the West,
00:19:09 - 00:19:13  |    that it was important for people to communicate with each other,
00:19:13 - 00:19:20  |    but if we think about it, three years before this cooperation was established,
00:19:20 - 00:19:23  |    the political climate was completely different.
00:19:23 - 00:19:28  |    Poland was in the Warsaw Pact, Denmark was in NATO.
00:19:28 - 00:19:34  |    Did you feel the difference?
00:19:34 - 00:19:48  |    I didn't think about it that much, but I was never interested in what was on the side.
00:19:48 - 00:19:53  |    For me, the most important thing was to have contact with people,
00:19:53 - 00:20:00  |    so that it wasn't artificial, so that it wasn't something written on paper.
00:20:00 - 00:20:06  |    In the meantime, I won the elections for the school principal in 1992.
00:20:06 - 00:20:13  |    A year earlier, I also started trips with groups, with children to Legoland, also in Denmark.
00:20:13 - 00:20:23  |    I thought that such a trip, such a trip, was more than, so to speak,
00:20:23 - 00:20:31  |    a learning experience, than sitting in a bench and theoretically looking at each other.
00:20:31 - 00:20:39  |    For me, practice was important, and I didn't really think about it at that time,
00:20:39 - 00:20:43  |    but I thought that what I do, I do well.
00:20:43 - 00:20:46  |    I never thought about this actually.
00:20:46 - 00:20:51  |    For me, what was the most important was this human connection,
00:20:51 - 00:20:55  |    and maybe not a bigger picture, the political situation, etc.
00:20:55 - 00:21:05  |    So back then, I became headmaster of the school, I started to take kids to Legoland,
00:21:05 - 00:21:12  |    I wanted to give them some real experience,
00:21:12 - 00:21:41  |    and I believe what I was doing back then, I did good, and that was the most important.
00:21:41 - 00:21:54  |    The delegation, it was in 1996, I think.
00:21:54 - 00:22:00  |    So this delegation that you had contact with in Denmark,
00:22:00 - 00:22:07  |    we don't really know these people, and we have never seen them.
00:22:07 - 00:22:10  |    As far as we can see, you brought some pictures.
00:22:10 - 00:22:16  |    The delegation that you mentioned, Bente, Nils, and also Wigo,
00:22:16 - 00:22:21  |    they never knew them personally, they had the pleasure of talking to Nils over the phone,
00:22:21 - 00:22:23  |    but they didn't see them.
00:22:23 - 00:22:26  |    Here I see that you have pictures, can you show them?
00:22:26 - 00:22:31  |    Yes, unfortunately Bente is no longer alive, Wigo died earlier.
00:22:31 - 00:22:36  |    From what I know, only Nils is alive.
00:22:36 - 00:22:43  |    Bente passed away, Wigo the same, but as far as she knows, Nils is the only one who is still alive.
00:22:43 - 00:22:51  |    She can show you the picture of them.
00:22:51 - 00:22:59  |    We have been on the phone with Nils and talking to him before we came here.
00:22:59 - 00:23:07  |    Yes, they were talking to Nils over the phone, and he was the one who directed them.
00:23:07 - 00:23:18  |    Here is Bente, this is 1996, these are the next stages of our cooperation.
00:23:18 - 00:23:24  |    Here is Bente, here is Nils.
00:23:24 - 00:23:36  |    Unfortunately, Wigo is no longer in any pictures, because he was the oldest of them.
00:23:36 - 00:23:40  |    And this is in Poland?
00:23:40 - 00:23:49  |    No, in Orginburg, Copenhagen.
00:23:49 - 00:23:57  |    And here is Bogdan Łapa.
00:23:57 - 00:24:01  |    This is Bogdan the mayor.
00:24:01 - 00:24:09  |    That's the Danish politician, Helge Eder Møller.
00:24:09 - 00:24:13  |    He was a soldier.
00:24:13 - 00:24:20  |    In the Danish parliament.
00:24:20 - 00:24:25  |    We were in the parliament, we were in Copenhagen.
00:24:25 - 00:24:29  |    They visited the parliament, they visited the town, Copenhagen.
00:24:29 - 00:24:33  |    Were you also on a trip to Kristiansborg?
00:24:33 - 00:24:35  |    To the parliament?
00:24:35 - 00:24:37  |    Yes, to the parliament.
00:24:37 - 00:24:44  |    Can you tell us a bit about the trip?
00:24:44 - 00:25:08  |    I don't remember much, because I was under the impression of everything.
00:25:08 - 00:25:17  |    Usula says that she was so impressed by everything that she does not remember a lot about this visit.
00:25:17 - 00:25:27  |    But this guy, Jerzy, he was also the local politician, and she remembers pretty well this visit to the parliament.
00:25:27 - 00:25:39  |    Because he was the leader of the council, and he was very interested in this.
00:25:39 - 00:25:46  |    For him, he was the head of this governmental body here in Żukowo.
00:25:46 - 00:25:51  |    He was a politician, and it was interesting for him how the parliament works.
00:25:51 - 00:26:02  |    Usula, she visited some parliaments already, so she was impressed, but she was also in charge of the whole trip, and she had other things to do.
00:26:02 - 00:26:06  |    But Jerzy was really interested in the parliament.
00:26:06 - 00:26:09  |    What was his name?
00:26:09 - 00:26:12  |    What are the names?
00:26:12 - 00:26:15  |    Do you remember the name of the mayor?
00:26:15 - 00:26:18  |    No, I don't remember, unfortunately.
00:26:18 - 00:26:28  |    This is a very exciting fort to see, we think it's very interesting.
00:26:28 - 00:26:31  |    I think it's very interesting for them.
00:26:31 - 00:26:46  |    We visited the fort, we were in a house for older people, the program was really rich.
00:26:46 - 00:26:52  |    So they saw really a lot of things in Denmark, and it was very, very interesting for them.
00:26:52 - 00:26:57  |    We can see you've been busy traveling in Denmark.
00:26:57 - 00:27:00  |    You didn't get bored there?
00:27:00 - 00:27:04  |    No, we lived, I live with my husband.
00:27:04 - 00:27:07  |    Pira and I were both born in the 90s.
00:27:07 - 00:27:17  |    It was in Wardenburg itself. Everything was in Wardenburg, and then we went to Copenhagen.
00:27:17 - 00:27:20  |    You started saying that you lived with your husband.
00:27:20 - 00:27:29  |    I lived with Bente and Eryka, and Bogdan and Jurek lived with Nils.
00:27:29 - 00:27:42  |    So Ushula and her husband, they lived with Bente, but Jerzy and the mayor, Bogdan Łapa, they lived with Nils in his house.
00:27:42 - 00:27:44  |    You said his name again.
00:27:44 - 00:27:52  |    Nils, Bente, Nils, Bente, Jerzy.
00:27:52 - 00:27:57  |    Who is this guy?
00:27:57 - 00:28:03  |    This is Jerzy Jaworski, this local politician.
00:28:03 - 00:28:07  |    He was a member of the town council.
00:28:07 - 00:28:09  |    Bogdan Łapa.
00:28:09 - 00:28:13  |    And there was also Bogdan, who was the mayor of Bogdan.
00:28:13 - 00:28:15  |    Bogdan and Jerzy.
00:28:15 - 00:28:17  |    All right.
00:28:17 - 00:28:25  |    At that time Bogdan was the mayor of Żuków, and now he's the mayor.
00:28:25 - 00:28:33  |    So Bogdan Łapa, back then he was the mayor of Żuków, and now he's the mayor.
00:28:33 - 00:28:37  |    And they were staying at Nils?
00:28:37 - 00:28:41  |    Yes, they lived with Nils.
00:28:41 - 00:28:43  |    In Wardenburg.
00:28:43 - 00:28:47  |    In his private home.
00:28:47 - 00:28:56  |    Yes, privately. As I said, since 1992 we lived only privately, in no hotels.
00:28:56 - 00:29:12  |    Bente also had a family rest house by the sea, and even with my teachers I was there.
00:29:12 - 00:29:20  |    We stayed at her house. We were a big group of teachers.
00:29:20 - 00:29:23  |    Here's Bente, here's Bente.
00:29:23 - 00:29:27  |    You can see that we were connected.
00:29:27 - 00:29:33  |    As I told you, I think starting in 1992 we stopped being in the hotels.
00:29:33 - 00:29:37  |    We lived with them in private houses, so Bente took us to her summer house.
00:29:37 - 00:29:39  |    It was really nice.
00:29:39 - 00:29:42  |    The whole group.
00:29:42 - 00:29:45  |    Ah, with Jose Aniston.
00:29:45 - 00:29:58  |    And here with us, somewhere, in my group of teachers, Bogdan Łapa's wife was a polonist.
00:29:58 - 00:30:03  |    She always went with us. She also swallowed Baccyla.
00:30:03 - 00:30:09  |    Here's Bente's house.
00:30:09 - 00:30:12  |    But the summer house.
00:30:12 - 00:30:16  |    You looked very happy on these trips to Denmark.
00:30:16 - 00:30:19  |    Were you very happy on these trips?
00:30:19 - 00:30:26  |    Yes, yes. I was happy that everything was developing.
00:30:26 - 00:30:30  |    Every year something new, every year new tasks.
00:30:30 - 00:30:39  |    I had the privilege of being able to call Bente from school.
00:30:39 - 00:30:46  |    If we didn't have this phone contact, we would talk almost every day.
00:30:46 - 00:30:50  |    What can we do, what is waiting for us.
00:30:50 - 00:31:00  |    And it helped me a lot. I could help myself professionally.
00:31:00 - 00:31:06  |    Yes, because each trip we had some new tasks, some new developments, so it was really exciting.
00:31:06 - 00:31:13  |    I could call Bente from my school, because the phone was really expensive.
00:31:13 - 00:31:19  |    We were talking every day, so it was really, really important.
00:31:19 - 00:31:24  |    Niels has told us that the two of them are living together.
00:31:24 - 00:31:27  |    The two masters and Jasen.
00:31:27 - 00:31:28  |    And who are you talking about?
00:31:28 - 00:31:30  |    Jasen and Jasen.
00:31:30 - 00:31:34  |    Are there any of them you have contacted today?
00:31:34 - 00:31:36  |    Ask Berner.
00:31:36 - 00:31:38  |    Do you know what they are talking about?
00:31:38 - 00:31:42  |    Yes.
00:31:42 - 00:31:51  |    We have been on the phone with Niels and he was also telling us that some people stayed with him.
00:31:51 - 00:32:00  |    Do you think that we can get in touch with some of the two persons that stayed at Niels?
00:32:00 - 00:32:15  |    Yes, he said that they talked with Niels on the phone, they didn't know him personally, and he also told them about the visit and the fact that he was visiting a few people at home.
00:32:15 - 00:32:20  |    I have to tell you that they don't know that they are going to meet Mr. Mierz.
00:32:20 - 00:32:23  |    Because they know everything about it.
00:32:23 - 00:32:24  |    Aha.
00:32:24 - 00:32:35  |    I prepared it for them, but they don't know yet. So they are asking if it is possible to meet Mr. Mierz and Mr. Bogdan. Are they still in Żuków?
00:32:35 - 00:32:44  |    I think that there is such an opportunity, because both Mierz and Bogdan live in Żuków.
00:32:44 - 00:32:57  |    We know each other, we are on the same level as you are, although in Denmark everything is different, but in Poland it is an honor to be on the same level with someone.
00:32:57 - 00:33:01  |    I think that they will be on the same level.
00:33:01 - 00:33:08  |    From what I know, they also remember the trip and the whole cooperation.
00:33:08 - 00:33:17  |    I think so, yes, because they both live in Żuków, and they are still here, and we are actually good friends with them.
00:33:17 - 00:33:25  |    We are friends, and in Poland it is a bit different, but yes.
00:33:25 - 00:33:36  |    They were very excited about this exchange with Rodinburg, they recall it as a very positive experience, and I think they will be happy to speak about it.
00:33:36 - 00:33:40  |    Do you know what they do today?
00:33:40 - 00:33:41  |    Yes.
00:33:41 - 00:33:44  |    What do they do today?
00:33:44 - 00:33:48  |    Do you know what they do?
00:33:48 - 00:34:06  |    Yes, as I said, Bogdan Łapa is our caretaker. He has already advanced, so to speak, compared to those years.
00:34:06 - 00:34:16  |    Jerzy is no longer an advisor, he runs a flower shop here in Żuków.
00:34:16 - 00:34:25  |    Yes, so I already told you that Bogdan went up in his political career, so he is the head of the whole area, not only in Żuków.
00:34:25 - 00:34:32  |    And Jerzy, he left politics, and he has a business, he runs a flower shop.
00:34:32 - 00:34:36  |    He sells flowers now?
00:34:36 - 00:34:39  |    Yes.
00:34:39 - 00:34:50  |    He has a flower shop, and his brother runs a bookstore together, and he has a flower shop in one building, here in the center of Żuków.
00:34:50 - 00:34:59  |    Yes, in the center of Żuków, he runs a flower shop, and his brother runs a bookshop in the same building.
00:34:59 - 00:35:06  |    Okay, so that means that they are actually pretty nearby right now.
00:35:06 - 00:35:12  |    How is it to see all these pictures? What are the memories?
00:35:12 - 00:35:14  |    Excuse me?
00:35:14 - 00:35:20  |    How does it feel for you to look at these old pictures? What are the memories of it?
00:35:20 - 00:35:28  |    When I contacted you, you told me that you have these pictures, but I assume that you haven't been looking at them for a long time.
00:35:28 - 00:35:33  |    So how do you look at these pictures now? What emotions and feelings do you have?
00:35:33 - 00:35:44  |    Well, I can't agree with it that many of my friends, I can say so clearly, are no longer there.
00:35:44 - 00:35:59  |    Because when I stopped working, in 2010 I retired, no, in 2002, I'm sorry, in 2002 I retired,
00:35:59 - 00:36:11  |    Bęta was still alive, and I have to say that she started getting sick, and our contacts were getting rarer.
00:36:11 - 00:36:16  |    Until one day I got the news that Bęta was dead.
00:36:16 - 00:36:26  |    I am sad about this, because you know for sure that the most important thing is the contact between people.
00:36:26 - 00:36:34  |    And it is us, people, who think about how it all comes together.
00:36:34 - 00:36:40  |    So actually, looking at these pictures, well, I feel sad that this connection has ended,
00:36:40 - 00:36:46  |    and that a lot of people who are on these pictures passed away.
00:36:46 - 00:36:56  |    So I retired in 2002, I think, and then I got the information that Bęta got sick, and our contact was more and more seldom.
00:36:56 - 00:37:00  |    And one day I found out that she passed away.
00:37:00 - 00:37:08  |    And this is sad because, as you know, making connections between people, between human beings is the most important,
00:37:08 - 00:37:13  |    and this is what makes us going forward.
00:37:13 - 00:37:22  |    The work you did to us seems very important for a group of people, and we really respect that.
00:37:22 - 00:37:44  |    The way you work and how you connected these two societies is very important, so my colleagues want to express their opinion on you.
00:37:44 - 00:38:12  |    I admit that it was really important,
00:38:12 - 00:38:18  |    and this 1996 was like the peak of all this activity.
00:38:18 - 00:38:26  |    We managed to show, even to whole Poland, what we did here with Vordenburg, like what was our activities.
00:38:26 - 00:38:42  |    From Żukowa's point of view, 20 families helped me, especially Lucina and Stanisław Sypionowie.
00:38:42 - 00:38:58  |    Unfortunately, they are no longer alive, they are the only Żukowa restaurant at that time, and they sponsored us a lot, because we couldn't afford many things.
00:38:58 - 00:39:04  |    They helped us a lot, just Lucina and Stasiu Sypionowie at that time.
00:39:04 - 00:39:12  |    So in this peak time, there were 20 local families helping me in this connection.
00:39:12 - 00:39:23  |    For example, back then there was only one restaurant in Żukowa, and to be honest, we couldn't afford all this.
00:39:23 - 00:39:31  |    The owners of this one restaurant sponsored a lot of meals.
00:39:31 - 00:39:35  |    It was different, very different times.
00:39:35 - 00:39:37  |    Is it difficult to talk about those times?
00:39:37 - 00:39:38  |    Yes.
00:39:38 - 00:39:39  |    Is it something that...
00:39:39 - 00:39:41  |    Take it out of the screen.
00:39:41 - 00:39:43  |    Also before.
00:39:43 - 00:39:44  |    Also before.
00:39:44 - 00:39:48  |    Yes, but also the time before. Is it something that is difficult to talk about?
00:39:48 - 00:40:03  |    Yes. Is it hard for you to talk about this time, but also the time before the Warsaw Pact ended?
00:40:03 - 00:40:27  |    During the 80s.
00:40:27 - 00:40:45  |    So looking at these pictures, is it difficult to talk about? And also, is it difficult to talk about the times during the Warsaw Pact?
00:40:45 - 00:40:57  |    I don't quite understand this question, but when you look at these pictures, is it difficult to talk about these experiences?
00:40:57 - 00:41:11  |    No, it's definitely not difficult for me, but at the moment I'm in such a moment that, unfortunately, tears flow into my eyes, because it was a great time.
00:41:11 - 00:41:22  |    I divided this into two questions, first about this time, so it is not difficult for me to talk about this, but now I have tears in my eyes, because it was such a great time.
00:41:22 - 00:41:24  |    And now I will ask about the 80s.
00:41:24 - 00:41:44  |    Do you have any memories from the 80s? Is it something that is difficult for you to call? I think it's about the 80s in Poland, when Poland was a communist country, that it was a mysterious time for them.
00:41:44 - 00:42:00  |    No, not for me, because I was always open to contact with people, and I made a pilot trip abroad to make this contact easier for people.
00:42:00 - 00:42:14  |    And these experiences that I gained, they were a percentage in the later years of my work.
00:42:30 - 00:42:40  |    And what I learned in the 80s, I could use in the 90s and later.

00:00:00 - 00:00:01  |    Meet Jasi.
00:00:03 - 00:00:04  |    Take it.
00:00:06 - 00:00:07  |    Great work.
00:00:10 - 00:00:11  |    Wait, wait, wait, sorry.
00:00:14 - 00:00:15  |    Olsengang.
00:00:15 - 00:00:17  |    The Olsengang.
00:00:17 - 00:00:19  |    Olsengang.
00:00:29 - 00:00:30  |    Thank you.
00:00:32 - 00:00:33  |    Hello.
00:00:33 - 00:00:34  |    Hello.
00:00:35 - 00:00:36  |    Nice to meet you.
00:00:36 - 00:00:37  |    Hello.
00:00:37 - 00:00:38  |    My name is Jurek.
00:00:38 - 00:00:39  |    Hello.
00:00:39 - 00:00:40  |    My name is Jurek.
00:00:40 - 00:00:41  |    My name is Jurek.
00:00:41 - 00:00:42  |    Hello.
00:00:42 - 00:00:43  |    Hello.
00:00:43 - 00:00:44  |    I'm Peter.
00:00:44 - 00:00:45  |    This is Bjorn.
00:00:45 - 00:00:46  |    Thank you.
00:00:46 - 00:00:47  |    You're very nice.
00:00:48 - 00:00:51  |    Thank you so much for taking the time to meet us.
00:00:51 - 00:00:52  |    No problem.
00:00:53 - 00:00:57  |    For me, I'm very happy to see you here in Poland.
00:00:58 - 00:01:01  |    Yeah, because you traveled a lot to Denmark and have visitors from Denmark.
00:01:01 - 00:01:02  |    Is that right?
00:01:02 - 00:01:03  |    Yes.
00:01:06 - 00:01:13  |    Why did you start doing the friendship arrangement with Denmark?
00:01:13 - 00:01:15  |    It was many years ago.
00:01:15 - 00:01:22  |    In this time, I was in the mayor of the common council in Skowoo.
00:01:22 - 00:01:30  |    We were going to Denmark because I have learned how is democratic system in Denmark.
00:01:30 - 00:01:33  |    How is organization common.
00:01:33 - 00:01:35  |    It was the first step.
00:01:35 - 00:01:40  |    My friend who is going together to Denmark.
00:01:40 - 00:01:45  |    For me and my friend in Poland, everything is new.
00:01:47 - 00:01:48  |    How do we do it?
00:01:48 - 00:01:49  |    What do we do?
00:01:49 - 00:01:50  |    What is better?
00:01:50 - 00:01:52  |    How is it in the common system?
00:01:53 - 00:01:54  |    It's very different.
00:01:56 - 00:01:58  |    We have learned everything.
00:01:58 - 00:02:10  |    Judges learn how to build new buildings around the common system.
00:02:10 - 00:02:11  |    Everything is new.
00:02:16 - 00:02:17  |    Should I ask?
00:02:17 - 00:02:18  |    Yes, just a second.
00:02:18 - 00:02:21  |    We talked about the weather up here.
00:02:21 - 00:02:23  |    Now maybe a little bit in Polish.
00:02:23 - 00:02:27  |    Yes, because you started in English.
00:02:27 - 00:02:29  |    That was my fault.
00:02:29 - 00:02:32  |    Jakub, should we have a machine here?
00:02:32 - 00:02:35  |    So we can do the interpretation.
00:02:35 - 00:02:37  |    What do you think?
00:02:37 - 00:02:40  |    If you want to do it in Polish, then yes.
00:02:40 - 00:02:43  |    Then I think we should do it in English.
00:02:44 - 00:02:47  |    Then it will be more fluid.
00:02:48 - 00:02:50  |    We only practice the technical part.
00:02:50 - 00:02:51  |    I know, I know.
00:02:54 - 00:02:56  |    You can start with this one.
00:02:56 - 00:02:57  |    I think so.
00:03:26 - 00:03:35  |    Peter, we are historians, but we are young historians.
00:03:35 - 00:03:38  |    Both of us were born in the 90s at the beginning.
00:03:38 - 00:03:45  |    And we are still learning about the reality before 1989.
00:03:45 - 00:03:51  |    What do you think are the most important differences between Poland and Denmark in the 80s?
00:03:51 - 00:03:53  |    What were they like?
00:03:53 - 00:03:55  |    It was an abyss.
00:03:55 - 00:04:01  |    There was an organized democratic system, and it was a totalitarian system.
00:04:01 - 00:04:06  |    The citizen had no influence on what was going on in the country.
00:04:06 - 00:04:08  |    There was a group of people who managed.
00:04:08 - 00:04:10  |    Just like today in Russia.
00:04:10 - 00:04:12  |    That's how it worked for me.
00:04:12 - 00:04:14  |    The mayor was the secretary of the party.
00:04:14 - 00:04:18  |    He made the decision whether I should get one pack of cotton,
00:04:18 - 00:04:21  |    one pack of wheat or two.
00:04:21 - 00:04:22  |    Right?
00:04:22 - 00:04:24  |    He was the secretary of the party.
00:04:24 - 00:04:28  |    There was also the government, but its competence was very low.
00:04:28 - 00:04:30  |    In Denmark it was completely different.
00:04:30 - 00:04:33  |    There, the citizens chose their representatives,
00:04:33 - 00:04:36  |    and they had a real influence on what was going on.
00:04:36 - 00:04:41  |    And they demanded from their representatives to make a promise.
00:04:41 - 00:04:43  |    And here it was an abyss.
00:04:43 - 00:04:46  |    So it was completely two different worlds.
00:04:46 - 00:04:49  |    In Denmark you had the democratic system,
00:04:49 - 00:04:55  |    and in Poland you had a totalitarian system, just like in Russia nowadays.
00:04:55 - 00:04:58  |    I can tell you about the examples.
00:04:58 - 00:05:02  |    For example, here, who had the power in our county?
00:05:02 - 00:05:06  |    It was the secretary, the representative of the party, the communist party.
00:05:06 - 00:05:10  |    And he, on his own, decided if I should get...
00:05:10 - 00:05:13  |    Well, I will not translate it precisely.
00:05:13 - 00:05:16  |    For example, it's not exactly what Jerzy said.
00:05:16 - 00:05:20  |    It's how many bricks I should get to build a new big street.
00:05:20 - 00:05:22  |    For example.
00:05:22 - 00:05:29  |    And so, you know, the person didn't have any influence on his life.
00:05:29 - 00:05:32  |    And in Denmark there was a democratic system,
00:05:32 - 00:05:36  |    which meant that the town hall council was...
00:05:36 - 00:05:41  |    Well, people decided on them in democratic elections,
00:05:41 - 00:05:46  |    and the city council had to, you know, make what they promised during the elections.
00:05:46 - 00:05:49  |    If not, they would be removed and changed by new people.
00:05:49 - 00:05:52  |    I will say a few words about the economy.
00:05:52 - 00:05:58  |    To become the director of the company, you had to belong to the party.
00:05:58 - 00:06:02  |    But the deputy director could be a specialist, without a party.
00:06:02 - 00:06:04  |    And that's how it was.
00:06:04 - 00:06:09  |    The committee of the party had to approve the position of the director.
00:06:09 - 00:06:12  |    There was no competition for the best choice.
00:06:12 - 00:06:15  |    Only the comrades divided the tables among themselves.
00:06:15 - 00:06:19  |    And the deputy was taken by experienced engineers, economists,
00:06:19 - 00:06:21  |    who were always at the back.
00:06:21 - 00:06:26  |    He was at the head of the company, and he was the deputy director.
00:06:26 - 00:06:29  |    And that's why it worked somehow.
00:06:29 - 00:06:31  |    So, this is another example.
00:06:31 - 00:06:35  |    So, for example, when you had a factory, the head of the factory,
00:06:35 - 00:06:38  |    it was the representative of the Communist Party.
00:06:38 - 00:06:42  |    He was appointed by the Communist Party, let's say, in Warsaw.
00:06:42 - 00:06:46  |    But he's the vice head of the factory.
00:06:46 - 00:06:51  |    That could be actually the specialist in this field of the factory.
00:06:51 - 00:06:57  |    And he was actually running the factory, not the head, not the director.
00:06:57 - 00:07:03  |    But it was impossible not to belong to the party and to become the head of the factory.
00:07:03 - 00:07:05  |    It was impossible.
00:07:05 - 00:07:07  |    That was how it was run.
00:07:07 - 00:07:12  |    I suspect, I suppose, in Denmark, it was completely different.
00:07:12 - 00:07:14  |    Yes.
00:07:14 - 00:07:16  |    One last question.
00:07:16 - 00:07:18  |    Somebody's talking.
00:07:18 - 00:07:20  |    Yeah.
00:07:20 - 00:07:24  |    One step this way.
00:07:24 - 00:07:26  |    Thank you so much.
00:07:26 - 00:07:28  |    Should I just stand here?
00:07:28 - 00:07:30  |    Yeah, please.
00:07:30 - 00:07:32  |    You should be ready, Michael.
00:07:32 - 00:07:42  |    When you met with your friends in Denmark in the 90s,
00:07:42 - 00:07:49  |    the reality at the time was that not many years ago you were kind of enemies,
00:07:49 - 00:07:51  |    but now you had to be friends.
00:07:51 - 00:07:57  |    You know, it was Warsaw Pact and NATO, but now it was no Warsaw Pact anymore.
00:07:57 - 00:08:05  |    That transition from being enemies to friends in such a short time, how did that work?
00:08:28 - 00:08:34  |    The Warsaw Pact, after 1989, existed for a very short time.
00:08:34 - 00:08:38  |    And we were in the late 90s.
00:08:38 - 00:08:44  |    So these relations, for us, of course, Denmark was in NATO,
00:08:44 - 00:08:46  |    and Poland dreamed of being in NATO.
00:08:46 - 00:08:48  |    To feel safe.
00:08:48 - 00:08:50  |    Which today, after all, comes true.
00:08:50 - 00:08:54  |    We have the history of the war in Ukraine today.
00:08:54 - 00:08:57  |    And that this Polish road was right.
00:08:57 - 00:08:59  |    And we shouldn't neglect it.
00:08:59 - 00:09:03  |    Secondly, Europe is a small village at the moment.
00:09:03 - 00:09:05  |    It's a small village.
00:09:05 - 00:09:09  |    And all citizens of Europe have the right to live in the same way.
00:09:09 - 00:09:12  |    And it doesn't matter if you're Danish or Polish.
00:09:12 - 00:09:17  |    It requires mutual respect, nothing more.
00:09:17 - 00:09:20  |    If we have different traditions, let's respect it.
00:09:20 - 00:09:23  |    But we have to be together, because there is no other way.
00:09:23 - 00:09:29  |    I called on the American physicist Micho Kaka,
00:09:29 - 00:09:35  |    who says that at some point the world will heal.
00:09:35 - 00:09:37  |    Because there is no other way.
00:09:37 - 00:09:40  |    Or we'll take care of the whole world together,
00:09:40 - 00:09:42  |    because no particular country has done anything.
00:09:42 - 00:09:44  |    Neither Denmark nor Poland will do anything,
00:09:44 - 00:09:46  |    but together we can do something.
00:09:46 - 00:09:48  |    And that's the only way.
00:09:48 - 00:09:52  |    And then the Warsaw Pact could exist because of that?
00:09:52 - 00:09:54  |    In 1992.
00:09:54 - 00:09:56  |    Yes.
00:09:56 - 00:09:59  |    When Wałęsa signed an agreement with Putin
00:09:59 - 00:10:01  |    to withdraw the troops.
00:10:01 - 00:10:03  |    In 1992.
00:10:03 - 00:10:06  |    So when we traveled, when I traveled to Denmark,
00:10:06 - 00:10:10  |    it was a couple of years after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist.
00:10:10 - 00:10:12  |    I think in 1992.
00:10:12 - 00:10:15  |    And then of course Denmark was in NATO.
00:10:15 - 00:10:18  |    But then in the middle of the 90s,
00:10:18 - 00:10:22  |    we dreamed about becoming a NATO member.
00:10:22 - 00:10:27  |    And now we know that it was the only way for us to secure our safety.
00:10:27 - 00:10:30  |    We can now appreciate how important it is to be in NATO.
00:10:30 - 00:10:37  |    So you have to remember that actually Europe is like a really small village.
00:10:37 - 00:10:44  |    And we should appreciate our differences,
00:10:44 - 00:10:47  |    we should deeply respect them, and we should cooperate.
00:10:47 - 00:10:52  |    This is the only way for Europe to exist and to make it through difficult times.
00:10:52 - 00:10:57  |    And there was this famous physician in the States
00:10:57 - 00:11:04  |    that said that the only way for the world is to become one.
00:11:04 - 00:11:09  |    Because only being one, we can move forward.
00:11:09 - 00:11:13  |    So Denmark will not achieve anything on its own,
00:11:13 - 00:11:15  |    Poland will not achieve anything on its own,
00:11:15 - 00:11:19  |    but if we cooperate, then yes, maybe we can move forward.
00:11:19 - 00:11:23  |    It was the greatest success of Mr. Wałęsa,
00:11:23 - 00:11:25  |    that he signed an agreement with Jelcin
00:11:25 - 00:11:27  |    about withdrawing the Soviet troops from Poland,
00:11:27 - 00:11:30  |    and that was the end of the Warsaw Pact.
00:11:30 - 00:11:34  |    As the last Russian soldier, he left Poland and Zenerda,
00:11:34 - 00:11:36  |    because that was an important matter,
00:11:36 - 00:11:38  |    because there was a powerful army there.
00:11:38 - 00:11:41  |    When these troops withdrew to the east,
00:11:41 - 00:11:45  |    the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist.
00:11:45 - 00:11:47  |    So the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist
00:11:47 - 00:11:51  |    when Mr. Wałęsa signed an agreement with Boris Jelcin
00:11:51 - 00:11:54  |    about the retreat of the Russian army from Poland.
00:11:54 - 00:11:56  |    So it was 1992, I think.
00:11:56 - 00:12:02  |    But also this Russian army left not only Poland, but also eastern Germany.
00:12:02 - 00:12:05  |    So when the last soldier left our soil,
00:12:05 - 00:12:09  |    then the Warsaw Pact ended.
00:12:09 - 00:12:12  |    That's the truth.
00:12:40 - 00:12:42  |    Thank you.
00:12:42 - 00:12:44  |    Hello.
00:12:44 - 00:12:46  |    Hello.
00:12:46 - 00:12:48  |    Nice to meet you.
00:12:48 - 00:12:50  |    Hi, I'm Jurek.
00:12:50 - 00:12:52  |    Hi, I'm Peter. Nice to meet you.
00:12:52 - 00:12:54  |    Jurek.
00:12:54 - 00:12:57  |    Welcome to my humble abode.
00:12:57 - 00:13:00  |    This is my shop with my brother.
00:13:00 - 00:13:10  |    Welcome to my humble flower shop. It belongs to me and my brother has a bookshop right next to it.
00:13:10 - 00:13:13  |    Here we live and here we work.
00:13:13 - 00:13:15  |    Thank you. Thank you so much.
00:13:15 - 00:13:17  |    This is my retirement fund.
00:13:17 - 00:13:20  |    This is my retirement fund.
00:13:20 - 00:13:24  |    It's really beautiful. It's really nice.
00:13:24 - 00:13:30  |    What would you like to hear about?
00:13:30 - 00:13:35  |    We talked to Ursula and she told us that you were in the group with her
00:13:35 - 00:13:42  |    that traveled to Denmark in the 90s and made friendships with Danish people there.
00:13:42 - 00:13:55  |    Why was that important to you to do back at the time?
00:14:12 - 00:14:15  |    It was a new organization.
00:14:15 - 00:14:17  |    For example, holding fairs.
00:14:17 - 00:14:19  |    For how many years?
00:14:19 - 00:14:21  |    What is optimal?
00:14:21 - 00:14:23  |    It was new information for us.
00:14:23 - 00:14:26  |    There was a completely different system in Poland, and it was different in Denmark.
00:14:26 - 00:14:28  |    We copied a lot of things from it.
00:14:28 - 00:14:31  |    It's not that it was just a non-productive ride.
00:14:31 - 00:14:33  |    We copied it.
00:14:33 - 00:14:40  |    We got to know the work systems of the City Council and, of course, the history of Denmark.
00:14:40 - 00:14:45  |    We were welcomed and we lived in the states of Lise and Nilsa,
00:14:45 - 00:14:47  |    who took care of us.
00:14:47 - 00:14:56  |    There was an organized group that led us to Vordienborg and also to Copenhagen.
00:14:56 - 00:14:59  |    What can I say?
00:14:59 - 00:15:05  |    After collecting this information, I already said, we implemented many solutions,
00:15:05 - 00:15:07  |    but not all of them.
00:15:07 - 00:15:10  |    We had social assistance.
00:15:10 - 00:15:14  |    There were two stages.
00:15:14 - 00:15:17  |    The first was for independent people,
00:15:17 - 00:15:20  |    and the second, for those who were not independent,
00:15:20 - 00:15:23  |    who were also taken care of by the Ministry.
00:15:23 - 00:15:27  |    From food to medical care, to daily care,
00:15:27 - 00:15:30  |    and that was a new experience.
00:15:30 - 00:15:33  |    Then we went to Copenhagen.
00:15:33 - 00:15:37  |    It was an organized trip to see how the Danish Parliament works.
00:15:37 - 00:15:40  |    We were at the session of the Danish Parliament.
00:15:40 - 00:15:45  |    A young man greeted us on the stairs of the Parliament.
00:15:45 - 00:15:48  |    He said, hi, hi, I was a colonel,
00:15:48 - 00:15:53  |    and now I am the chairman of the National Defense Commission of the Danish Parliament.
00:15:53 - 00:15:56  |    I will show you what the Parliament looks like.
00:15:56 - 00:16:03  |    We were also surprised, because he said that he was interested in the Polish army.
00:16:03 - 00:16:06  |    He was interested in what was going on in Poland.
00:16:06 - 00:16:10  |    It was a pleasant conversation.
00:16:10 - 00:16:14  |    I said that I feel good in Denmark, because we are from Pomerania.
00:16:14 - 00:16:17  |    Pomerania was once in Denmark, so I am at home.
00:16:17 - 00:16:19  |    Maybe I will introduce myself.
00:16:19 - 00:16:23  |    We went there at the beginning of the 90s.
00:16:23 - 00:16:29  |    We were invited by Danish people, by Vordenborg, so we went there.
00:16:29 - 00:16:35  |    For me, I was the head of the town council here in Nizhukowo.
00:16:35 - 00:16:39  |    I went there just to see how the democratic system works in Denmark,
00:16:39 - 00:16:43  |    because it was the beginning of the 90s.
00:16:43 - 00:16:48  |    Many solutions from there we copied to Poland, and they still are here.
00:16:48 - 00:16:53  |    It was how to make public bids, how the social welfare works, for example.
00:16:53 - 00:16:57  |    For me, that was the main scope to do it.
00:16:57 - 00:17:04  |    When we were in Vordenborg, we were hosted by Nils and Lisa.
00:17:04 - 00:17:09  |    They showed us around Vordenborg, but also we went to Copenhagen.
00:17:09 - 00:17:12  |    We visited the Parliament.
00:17:12 - 00:17:16  |    We were at the Parliament session to see how the Parliament works.
00:17:16 - 00:17:27  |    We were welcomed by the man who had something to do with the national defense.
00:17:27 - 00:17:29  |    He showed us around.
00:17:29 - 00:17:35  |    He also said that he was interested in Polish military, so it was also interesting.
00:17:35 - 00:17:40  |    I told them that we were from Pomerania, so from this part of Poland,
00:17:40 - 00:17:44  |    and Pomerania back in the past belonged to Denmark.
00:17:44 - 00:17:49  |    So I said I knew the truth.
00:17:49 - 00:17:56  |    After visiting Copenhagen, we visited Sörenka,
00:17:56 - 00:18:01  |    which was Polish as a model.
00:18:01 - 00:18:07  |    We were also shown how the milking industry works, how the cooperation works.
00:18:07 - 00:18:12  |    We visited the Buko concert, the biggest one in Denmark,
00:18:12 - 00:18:14  |    which produces dairy products.
00:18:14 - 00:18:16  |    We met the president.
00:18:16 - 00:18:21  |    We were invited by the president of the concert to the house for good wine and good cheese.
00:18:21 - 00:18:25  |    Of course, after that, I had the pleasure of hosting him at my own home.
00:18:25 - 00:18:28  |    The people from Denmark also came to us.
00:18:28 - 00:18:30  |    I hosted them at my own home.
00:18:30 - 00:18:35  |    Thanks to Ula, because she was leading the exchange.
00:18:35 - 00:18:38  |    In fact, it was a fruitful exchange.
00:18:38 - 00:18:44  |    When the activity ended in Uppsala, I stopped being a friend of mine.
00:18:44 - 00:18:47  |    I didn't want to continue working.
00:18:47 - 00:18:51  |    I couldn't and I didn't want to continue working socially.
00:18:51 - 00:19:11  |    We also went to see the Siren in Copenhagen.
00:19:11 - 00:19:13  |    We met the head of this company.
00:19:13 - 00:19:17  |    He invited us for very good wine and very good cheeses.
00:19:17 - 00:19:25  |    Then, thanks to Ula, when he came to Poland, we hosted him at our home.
00:19:25 - 00:19:31  |    We also saw how this milking industry functions in Denmark.
00:19:31 - 00:19:38  |    For me, this whole adventure ended when I stopped being the city council.
00:19:38 - 00:19:45  |    I became tired of working in this environment.
00:19:45 - 00:19:53  |    So, you went to Denmark to see if you could learn something you could bring back home to Poland.
00:19:53 - 00:19:56  |    Did you experience the people from Denmark?
00:19:56 - 00:19:59  |    They went to Poland and brought home something that they learned from you?
00:19:59 - 00:20:02  |    Yes, for example, very often...
00:20:02 - 00:20:04  |    You can answer in Polish if it's easier.
00:20:04 - 00:20:16  |    In Denmark, we held tenders for 10 years. In Poland, it was usually for 3 years.
00:20:16 - 00:20:19  |    In Żukowo, we held tenders for 10 years.
00:20:19 - 00:20:25  |    The reason was that the company that won the tender had to buy machines and teach people.
00:20:25 - 00:20:34  |    You can't hold tenders for 3 years and then take the next ones.
00:20:34 - 00:20:39  |    Tenders for 10 years are optimal for local governments.
00:20:39 - 00:20:45  |    The less property the local government has, the better.
00:20:45 - 00:20:55  |    It's easier for the residents to make a living out of it than for the government to keep their personal property
00:20:55 - 00:21:01  |    and have a small influence on what's going on in the companies that are in charge of the government.
00:21:01 - 00:21:04  |    It's a difficult thing to manage.
00:21:04 - 00:21:08  |    A private company has to do everything according to the contract.
00:21:08 - 00:21:10  |    And it will do it.
00:21:10 - 00:21:13  |    But if it's a government-owned company, it's not always.
00:21:13 - 00:21:18  |    So, you actually said what the polls led from the Danish community.
00:21:18 - 00:21:20  |    So, the public bids...
00:21:20 - 00:21:23  |    In Denmark, they were made for 10 years.
00:21:23 - 00:21:28  |    And in Poland, before they introduced it, it was only for 3 years.
00:21:28 - 00:21:36  |    So, when the private company was paid by the local government to do something,
00:21:36 - 00:21:43  |    when they did it for 10 years, first they had to buy some machines, for example, to learn how to do this.
00:21:43 - 00:21:46  |    So, 10 years was ideal.
00:21:46 - 00:21:48  |    And 3 years was too short.
00:21:48 - 00:21:53  |    Because after 3 years, we were telling them, okay, so now we changed the service provider
00:21:53 - 00:21:55  |    and they had to change the components.
00:21:55 - 00:21:58  |    10 years, it was a very good period of time.
00:21:58 - 00:22:06  |    And also we learned from them that some activities like the local government should outsource to private companies.
00:22:06 - 00:22:09  |    Because they will do it for sure.
00:22:09 - 00:22:13  |    What's in the contract, they will do it on time, within the budget.
00:22:13 - 00:22:20  |    And if those services were kept in the local government, the quality was not that good.
00:22:20 - 00:22:22  |    Okay.
00:22:22 - 00:22:29  |    When you think back on the time when you were creating these friendships and you were learning from each other,
00:22:29 - 00:22:56  |    what is the first thing that comes to mind?
00:22:56 - 00:23:22  |    So, my recollection is very positive, because back then, at the beginning of the 90s, Poland had so much to learn.
00:23:22 - 00:23:29  |    And it's better to learn from someone who knows things and already made some mistakes in the past.
00:23:29 - 00:23:36  |    And learning from Denmark, it was very good, because Danish people didn't feel superior.
00:23:36 - 00:23:41  |    They were very normal and they treated us fair.
00:23:41 - 00:23:49  |    And how do you see, do you still see some of the things that you learned back in the 90s today here in Poland?
00:23:49 - 00:23:56  |    The situation is completely different now in Poland.
00:23:56 - 00:24:01  |    It's hard for me to say, because Poles learned a lot, we did a lot.
00:24:01 - 00:24:04  |    And right now, I have no contact with what is going on.
00:24:04 - 00:24:08  |    For sure, Denmark is moving forward, because everyone is learning from mistakes.
00:24:08 - 00:24:11  |    They are moving forward, they have new solutions.
00:24:11 - 00:24:16  |    And right now, what is happening, because of my social activity, I don't know.
00:24:16 - 00:24:19  |    I don't want to take the vote, I don't want to make a mistake.
00:24:46 - 00:24:55  |    Try to explain to us, we were born in the 90s, we didn't experience what Europe was like before in the 80s.
00:24:55 - 00:25:02  |    Can you explain to us, what was it like being a Polish person living in Poland in the 80s and the 70s?
00:25:02 - 00:25:23  |    How was that different from what happened in the 90s?
00:25:23 - 00:25:32  |    Well, there are two completely different worlds. There are two different worlds, because in the communist system,
00:25:32 - 00:25:35  |    I had the assumption that the citizen takes care of the state.
00:25:35 - 00:25:38  |    So other citizens create his life.
00:25:38 - 00:25:42  |    This solution is for the ban, it doesn't lead to anything.
00:25:42 - 00:25:47  |    People have to be independent, they have to have the right to decide about themselves, what they want to do and how they want to do it.
00:25:47 - 00:25:53  |    And the change that took place in 1989, when we won the elections, because I was in the People's Committee,
00:25:53 - 00:25:59  |    the People's Committee won the elections, there were no communists in the New Council.
00:25:59 - 00:26:05  |    But we entered without knowing how to manage, we didn't know how to do it.
00:26:05 - 00:26:13  |    And it was only this experience that caused the country, making new experiences, to develop quickly.
00:26:13 - 00:26:17  |    Of course, there were mistakes made, but there are two completely different worlds.
00:26:17 - 00:26:19  |    This cannot be described.
00:26:19 - 00:26:47  |    If you read Orwell, it would look like this, but today Orwell is also alive in Poland.
00:26:50 - 00:26:52  |    And it doesn't work at all.
00:26:52 - 00:27:02  |    And in the new world, what we have now, you decide on your life, you make decisions, etc.
00:27:02 - 00:27:13  |    So I was in the local government, in 1989, I think, or maybe later, we won the local elections,
00:27:13 - 00:27:17  |    and the communists were out of the local government.
00:27:17 - 00:27:26  |    So we were like, you know, we represented citizens, but the thing was that we were completely new to this.
00:27:26 - 00:27:31  |    We didn't know how to handle the local government, so we had to learn everything.
00:27:31 - 00:27:40  |    We made mistakes, for sure, but the changes were really, really, like we made really, really fast progress.
00:27:40 - 00:27:46  |    It sounds like a difficult and fast transformation.
00:27:46 - 00:27:49  |    This transformation was fast.
00:27:49 - 00:27:52  |    It was fast and unexpected for the general public.
00:27:52 - 00:27:58  |    At that time, we didn't know yet how the communist authorities were behaving.
00:27:58 - 00:28:02  |    It wasn't such a nice story that everything went well.
00:28:02 - 00:28:06  |    After all, the authorities at that time were in the hands of the communists,
00:28:06 - 00:28:12  |    that is, the militia, the army, the special services, and we were amateurs.
00:28:12 - 00:28:21  |    And the understanding that fell into Poland at the round table is a model example of the nation's wisdom.
00:28:21 - 00:28:24  |    Without bloodshed, it could have been done.
00:28:24 - 00:28:28  |    People don't remember about it, they just don't have the knowledge.
00:28:28 - 00:28:42  |    It's so sad sometimes.
00:28:58 - 00:29:09  |    And it was very wise to decide on the new order of Poland without spilling the blood.
00:29:09 - 00:29:12  |    Now people don't remember about this.
00:29:12 - 00:29:19  |    This round table is very often criticized, but the transition was not violent.
00:29:19 - 00:29:24  |    And please remember that the Soviet troops were stationed in Poland, right?
00:29:24 - 00:29:29  |    Poland was not an independent country, and it was not known how the Soviets were behaving.
00:29:29 - 00:29:33  |    At the moment, after such a time, we have an example of Ukraine today.
00:29:33 - 00:29:36  |    How could they behave? How could they behave?
00:29:36 - 00:30:05  |    So it's hard to assess history with so little information.
00:30:05 - 00:30:11  |    Was it?
00:30:11 - 00:30:20  |    Look at us when you're ending. Thank you.
00:30:20 - 00:30:25  |    The friends you made in Denmark, did they understand the transition you were going through?
00:30:25 - 00:30:44  |    Did they understand all of the jobs you had in front of you, building up a new system in Poland?
00:30:44 - 00:30:55  |    No, they didn't realize it. They didn't think about what would happen, because it was two completely different worlds.
00:30:55 - 00:30:59  |    The lack of information from the Danes about the communist system was very weak.
00:30:59 - 00:31:02  |    They didn't see what could be done.
00:31:02 - 00:31:05  |    This is a huge thing that has been done in Poland at the moment.
00:31:05 - 00:31:12  |    Nobody realized that it was possible to rise so quickly.
00:31:12 - 00:31:18  |    And the Danes didn't realize that we would go in this direction at such a pace.
00:31:43 - 00:31:53  |    Ursula told us that you stayed with Nils, a guy from Denmark, when you were there.
00:31:53 - 00:32:01  |    You and Nils, could you talk about politics in Poland when you were together?
00:32:01 - 00:32:12  |    Nils was very open. At the same time, he also took care of the brotherhood of St. George. He was one of the organizers.
00:32:12 - 00:32:18  |    He was open to move forward.
00:32:18 - 00:32:27  |    He listened to us, and when we told him what was going on in Poland, it was completely new information for him, a bit shocking.
00:32:27 - 00:32:34  |    I told him how the communist system worked. He looked at it with disbelief.
00:32:57 - 00:33:06  |    When you visited the Danish parliament in Copenhagen, was it you who wanted to go, or did Nils or the Danish group take you there?
00:33:06 - 00:33:14  |    Yes, Nils and Lisa were together. They were together in the Jewish parliament.
00:33:14 - 00:33:27  |    Who came up with the idea of going to the Polish parliament? I won't tell you now, but I think it was organized by the group that Ula knew.
00:33:27 - 00:33:33  |    I take it very positively when I work in the Danish parliament.
00:33:33 - 00:33:41  |    It also happens in Poland that five people were sitting at the session and it was the same in the Danish parliament.
00:33:41 - 00:33:51  |    I don't know who organized the trip to the parliament. I think it was made by the Danish part,
00:33:51 - 00:33:57  |    but I evaluated it as a very positive experience to see how the parliament worked there.
00:33:57 - 00:34:05  |    I remember it was like even in the Polish parliament it was the same that sometimes there were just five people in the room.
00:34:05 - 00:34:15  |    I can say one more symbolic thing. The chairman of the National Defense Commission of Denmark brought us to the memory room
00:34:15 - 00:34:27  |    and showed us the portraits of the parliamentarians. He said, this is my grandfather, this is my father, this was my mother, and now I will be the one hanging there.
00:34:27 - 00:34:37  |    So I can tell you the symbolic scene that when we were hosted by this guy who was the head of the Defense Commission back then,
00:34:37 - 00:34:49  |    he showed us some pictures hanging there in the parliament. He told me, this is my grandfather, this is my father, and I will be next.
00:34:49 - 00:35:03  |    Do you remember the man who showed you around at the parliament?
00:35:03 - 00:35:19  |    I heard that he was the Minister of National Defense of Denmark. He said, I will continue to serve the country.
00:35:19 - 00:35:25  |    He told me, my duty is to serve my country, and I know he became the Minister of National Defense.
00:35:25 - 00:35:33  |    We saw pictures when we were with Ursula earlier, and we recognized him right away.
00:35:33 - 00:35:39  |    Oh, that is Helge Eder Møller, a big Danish politician who worked a lot with the defense.
00:35:39 - 00:36:07  |    Yes, he was a very kind man. I remember he had a lot of knowledge about the communist system.
00:36:07 - 00:36:13  |    This was his interest, and he specialized in this.
00:36:13 - 00:36:25  |    Helge Eder Møller is special forces, so I can imagine that he had interest also in Polish military.
00:36:25 - 00:36:31  |    Did he ask you anything about Polish military and Polish military history?
00:36:31 - 00:36:53  |    No, he just joked a little, because according to his stories, he was interested in his work in Poland.
00:36:53 - 00:37:03  |    So he had more knowledge than the rest.
00:37:23 - 00:37:35  |    Did Nils show any interest in getting to know something about the differences in Polish and Danish military?
00:37:35 - 00:37:53  |    Nils was also with you, wasn't he? Yes, he was.
00:37:53 - 00:38:07  |    Did he want to show how the parliament works?
00:38:07 - 00:38:15  |    Not really. They wanted to show us how the parliament functioned. It was not about the details.
00:38:15 - 00:38:31  |    I have a little note, because when you're listening to Marcin translating, it's nice if you look at these people and talk to these people instead of Marcin.
00:38:31 - 00:38:47  |    Because we edited Marcin's outfit.
00:38:47 - 00:39:01  |    Sorry. Just a moment. I'm a little worried about what we're going to do next.
00:39:01 - 00:39:17  |    I'm a little worried about what we're going to do next.
00:39:17 - 00:39:37  |    It's good. Everything is very good.
00:39:37 - 00:40:03  |    We talked to Nils about the meeting you had in parliament, and he told us about some myth or a story that maybe you once were a special diver in Polish military, and you went to Bornholm and found a stone on Hamasów that you brought back to Poland. Is that right?
00:40:03 - 00:40:27  |    Yes. They talked to Nils on the phone, but Nils heard about some myth or a story that Polish divers went to Bornholm and found a stone there. Do you know anything about it?
00:40:27 - 00:40:41  |    No, I don't know anything. For me, it's new information.
00:40:41 - 00:40:53  |    I could have forgotten about it, but I don't remember it.
00:40:53 - 00:41:07  |    We also talked to Heliator Møller.
00:41:07 - 00:41:23  |    He told us when you were at the parliament that Heliator Møller was really interested in your very good English skills.
00:41:23 - 00:41:43  |    Heliator Møller, the Minister of Defense.
00:41:43 - 00:42:03  |    That's true. I was just an interpreter.
00:42:03 - 00:42:13  |    Were you in the military?
00:42:13 - 00:42:23  |    I was never in the military. I studied, so if you go to the university, you don't have to go to the military.
00:42:23 - 00:42:43  |    I think it could be interesting to ask you. We're doing this program to give a historical look at the present, but part of what we're doing is all the secrets that have happened between the two nations of Poland.
00:42:43 - 00:42:53  |    What do you think about that?
00:43:13 - 00:43:25  |    People who do not want to talk about that part of history. Is that something you can relate to? Have you experienced the same?
00:43:25 - 00:43:43  |    The whole program shows how the world has changed since the 70s and 80s after the end of the Warsaw Pact and the relations between Poland and Denmark.
00:43:43 - 00:44:03  |    Have you experienced the same? Have you experienced the same? Have you experienced the same?
00:44:03 - 00:44:17  |    It was only due to the lack of information between the European countries and Poland. We were not allowed to travel to Denmark or Germany. We didn't have passports.
00:44:17 - 00:44:33  |    In order to go to work or anywhere in the West, you had to have a passport. You had to write in a post and very often there was a refusal due to social differences.
00:44:33 - 00:44:47  |    There were no newspapers that reached Poland and the West. They were treated as a taboo. There was no information. On the other hand, it was an abnormal world.
00:44:47 - 00:45:07  |    It was a mystery, but it was not due to the lack of information. What is the basis?
00:45:07 - 00:45:18  |    Before 1989, even to leave for the West, it was very difficult. We didn't have passports at home. The passports were at the police station. You had to apply for the passport.
00:45:18 - 00:45:27  |    You had to provide the reason of leaving the country. It was difficult. We were isolated and there was no information flow.
00:45:27 - 00:45:38  |    If there is no information flow, there is not even secrecy, but this feeling of secrecy. You don't know something, so you find it secret.
00:45:38 - 00:45:59  |    Although you don't have a background in the military, have you ever heard about rumors that special forces from the Warsaw Pact should be on Bornholm during the Cold War and maybe do training on the island?
00:45:59 - 00:46:09  |    The chairman of the National Defense Commission in Denmark told me that the Warsaw Pact had the Polish Armed Forces,
00:46:09 - 00:46:30  |    which was the idea of defense. So the Polish army had a significant role in the defense of Denmark.
00:46:30 - 00:46:43  |    That was the idea of defense. So the Polish army had to be in Denmark. That was the information of the chairman of the National Defense Commission in Denmark.
00:46:43 - 00:47:01  |    I looked at him and they didn't believe me. Maybe it was true.
00:47:13 - 00:47:34  |    So he knew about the situation in Poland, but with a smile on his face.
00:47:43 - 00:48:08  |    What I remembered, I will tell you.
00:48:08 - 00:48:13  |    Thank you for your attention.

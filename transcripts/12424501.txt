00:00:00 - 00:00:06  |    They said that if I did it, it would be like paying a special fee
00:00:06 - 00:00:10  |    because they called it a legal opening, which I said I didn't do it.
00:00:11 - 00:00:14  |    So after that, they started to force me,
00:00:14 - 00:00:19  |    like Thai people use the word force to make me feel uncomfortable.
00:00:19 - 00:00:21  |    I don't know what to say.
00:00:21 - 00:00:28  |    So what we're talking about now is almost six years old.
00:00:28 - 00:00:33  |    And she was told that you get extra money for that.
00:00:33 - 00:00:36  |    And especially when she didn't wear it before.
00:00:36 - 00:00:39  |    They called it a legal opening.
00:00:39 - 00:00:44  |    And she was told that every day and was pressured to do it.
00:00:44 - 00:00:53  |    How did she feel in that period when she was supposed to do it?
00:00:53 - 00:01:00  |    How did you feel when they forced you to do it?
00:01:00 - 00:01:03  |    I felt uncomfortable. I cried every day.
00:01:03 - 00:01:07  |    But I couldn't run anywhere. It was her house.
00:01:07 - 00:01:10  |    I didn't know where to run because she lied to me.
00:01:10 - 00:01:14  |    She told me not to get on the train or get arrested by the police.
00:01:14 - 00:01:17  |    And when I went to buy food, they would take me there.
00:01:19 - 00:01:25  |    She was pressured and afraid of what I would do.
00:01:25 - 00:01:31  |    They told me that if I took a bus or a train from here,
00:01:31 - 00:01:37  |    the police would take me to jail because I didn't have a visa.
00:01:37 - 00:01:40  |    That's why you didn't have a visa.
00:01:40 - 00:01:45  |    When they forced you to buy food, they would take you there.
00:01:48 - 00:01:50  |    How did the customers treat you?
00:01:50 - 00:01:53  |    How did the customers treat you?
00:01:53 - 00:01:56  |    How did they force you to do it?
00:01:56 - 00:01:59  |    How did they treat you?
00:01:59 - 00:02:07  |    They treated me like a drunk person.
00:02:07 - 00:02:12  |    They forced me to work all day and night.
00:02:12 - 00:02:15  |    Sometimes I was drunk.
00:02:15 - 00:02:19  |    They treated me like a drunk person.
00:02:19 - 00:02:24  |    They didn't help me. They scolded me.
00:02:24 - 00:02:32  |    There are many different types of customers.
00:02:32 - 00:02:37  |    There are also people who are polite and good.
00:02:37 - 00:02:43  |    There are also people who are full before they arrive.
00:02:43 - 00:02:46  |    Because they are open 24 hours a day.
00:02:46 - 00:02:50  |    There are also a lot of people who are full.
00:02:50 - 00:02:54  |    They are not polite. They are rude.
00:02:54 - 00:02:59  |    They scold her and say rude things to her.
00:03:01 - 00:03:08  |    Would you stand in the red all day?
00:03:08 - 00:03:13  |    I had to wait for the customer every 7 days.
00:03:13 - 00:03:16  |    Sometimes I slept like this.
00:03:16 - 00:03:21  |    If I didn't know how to open the door, they would open the door themselves.
00:03:21 - 00:03:24  |    They would open the door and call me to come down.
00:03:26 - 00:03:31  |    She had to be patient for 24 hours.
00:03:31 - 00:03:39  |    When I went to bed, if it was morning, she would open the door.
00:03:39 - 00:03:45  |    If she didn't do that, the owner of the house or the place
00:03:45 - 00:03:48  |    would come down and open the door.
00:03:48 - 00:03:52  |    Then she would wake up and go to work.
00:03:52 - 00:03:56  |    She had to do this every month.
00:03:56 - 00:04:02  |    When she had menstruation, she would take a break.
00:04:02 - 00:04:05  |    She would take a break.
00:04:05 - 00:04:08  |    Did you ever get money yourself?
00:04:08 - 00:04:12  |    Did they give you money?
00:04:12 - 00:04:19  |    When I didn't have money, they didn't give me any money.
00:04:19 - 00:04:23  |    They gave me money every time I worked.
00:04:23 - 00:04:26  |    They would give me money every 15 days.
00:04:26 - 00:04:28  |    Every 15 days a month.
00:04:28 - 00:04:32  |    They would write on paper that they would give me this much.
00:04:32 - 00:04:36  |    Half of the shop and half of the tag.
00:04:36 - 00:04:38  |    I didn't have any money.
00:04:38 - 00:04:41  |    They would send it home for 20,000 baht.
00:04:41 - 00:04:44  |    If I had money, it would be around 4,000 kroner.
00:04:44 - 00:04:50  |    But they would think that I would send it home for 5,500 baht.
00:04:50 - 00:04:55  |    I had to pay them for 5,500 baht.
00:04:55 - 00:04:58  |    I had to pay them for 5,500 baht.
00:04:58 - 00:05:00  |    For 3 months?
00:05:00 - 00:05:01  |    Yes.
00:05:01 - 00:05:05  |    And I had to pay for food for 1,500 baht a month.
00:05:05 - 00:05:15  |    At first, she had that tag that they called hand-truss.
00:05:15 - 00:05:19  |    Hand-truss goes to the shop, to the research unit.
00:05:19 - 00:05:25  |    And another hand-truss goes to the tag that is the money.
00:05:25 - 00:05:28  |    That they call for the tag.
00:05:28 - 00:05:39  |    And then she gets 4,000 kroner a month to transfer to Thailand, to her family.
00:05:39 - 00:05:41  |    But she hasn't got the money in her hand.
00:05:41 - 00:05:44  |    These people arrange it all for her.
00:05:44 - 00:05:48  |    And she has to pay 1,500 for food.
00:05:48 - 00:05:53  |    So it would be 5,500.
00:05:53 - 00:05:57  |    It's also the cost of sending money to Thailand.
00:05:57 - 00:05:59  |    She also has to pay for that.
00:05:59 - 00:06:04  |    So it's transferred to Thailand for 4,000 kroner.
00:06:04 - 00:06:07  |    That's 20,000 baht.
00:06:07 - 00:06:10  |    So the family has got some money.
00:06:10 - 00:06:12  |    4,000 kroner a month.
00:06:12 - 00:06:14  |    No, 4,000 kroner.
00:06:14 - 00:06:15  |    Yes, 4,000 kroner a month.
00:06:15 - 00:06:17  |    20,000 baht approximately.
00:06:17 - 00:06:20  |    And the 1,500, did she get them in her hand to buy food for?
00:06:20 - 00:06:22  |    Or was there food in the hand-truss?
00:06:22 - 00:06:24  |    There was food in the hand-truss.
00:06:24 - 00:06:27  |    No, she got them in her hand from the money.
00:06:27 - 00:06:29  |    She didn't give me the money.
00:06:29 - 00:06:33  |    She wrote on the paper that I was her assistant.
00:06:33 - 00:06:35  |    1 month.
00:06:35 - 00:06:41  |    For example, 1 month for each person can get around 20,000 kroner.
00:06:41 - 00:06:46  |    She said that the house fee was 1,500.
00:06:46 - 00:06:48  |    House fee was 1,500.
00:06:48 - 00:06:51  |    And the house fee was 5,500.
00:06:51 - 00:06:53  |    The house fee was 5,500.
00:06:53 - 00:06:55  |    Yes, 5,500 kroner.
00:06:55 - 00:06:57  |    So 4,000 kroner was in there?
00:06:57 - 00:06:59  |    Yes, she added more.
00:06:59 - 00:07:01  |    4,000 kroner was in there.
00:07:01 - 00:07:03  |    Okay.
00:07:03 - 00:07:05  |    What about the food fee?
00:07:05 - 00:07:07  |    The food fee was 1,500.
00:07:07 - 00:07:09  |    The house fee was 1,500.
00:07:09 - 00:07:12  |    No, the house fee and food fee were 1,500.
00:07:12 - 00:07:15  |    And the money was only 20,000 baht, right?
00:07:15 - 00:07:18  |    But she added 5,500.
00:07:18 - 00:07:20  |    Okay, I understand.
00:07:20 - 00:07:23  |    She doesn't see the money. She doesn't have the money in her hand.
00:07:23 - 00:07:26  |    The only thing she has seen is a piece of paper where she was shown
00:07:26 - 00:07:29  |    to see how much money you have.
00:07:29 - 00:07:31  |    You have money with me now.
00:07:31 - 00:07:33  |    How much money.
00:07:36 - 00:07:41  |    For example, she said that she earned 20,000 Danish kroner that month.
00:07:41 - 00:07:48  |    Then 5,500 goes to the owners she was supposed to help with.
00:07:48 - 00:07:50  |    For the 4,000 kroner in Thailand,
00:07:50 - 00:07:52  |    the rest is up to her.
00:07:52 - 00:07:55  |    Because it's the cost of the money.
00:07:55 - 00:07:59  |    The food and the house fee was 1,500.
00:07:59 - 00:08:01  |    That's what she was supposed to pay.
00:08:01 - 00:08:06  |    And the rest of the money was deducted from the money?
00:08:06 - 00:08:08  |    Yes.
00:08:08 - 00:08:10  |    It's not over yet.
00:08:10 - 00:08:12  |    Because they keep adding more and more.
00:08:12 - 00:08:14  |    She said that the money was not finished.
00:08:14 - 00:08:17  |    Because it was only coming from the young people.
00:08:17 - 00:08:19  |    And the money that she could earn every day,
00:08:19 - 00:08:21  |    she would keep it with her.
00:08:21 - 00:08:23  |    She wouldn't give it to the police.
00:08:23 - 00:08:25  |    Because she said that if the police caught her,
00:08:25 - 00:08:27  |    she would take the money.
00:08:27 - 00:08:29  |    She would take the valuable things, like gold,
00:08:29 - 00:08:31  |    or whatever she had.
00:08:31 - 00:08:33  |    Because if the police caught her,
00:08:33 - 00:08:35  |    she would take the money.
00:08:35 - 00:08:37  |    But actually, no.
00:08:37 - 00:08:39  |    It's her principle.
00:08:39 - 00:08:44  |    First of all, she said that she was going to help her with her money.
00:08:44 - 00:08:46  |    Because in Denmark,
00:08:46 - 00:08:48  |    if the police caught you,
00:08:48 - 00:08:50  |    and you have a lot of money on you,
00:08:50 - 00:08:52  |    and you don't have a will,
00:08:52 - 00:08:54  |    then the police will take the money from you.
00:08:54 - 00:08:56  |    How many were you forced to be with?
00:08:56 - 00:08:58  |    What do you think?
00:08:58 - 00:09:00  |    Sexually?
00:09:00 - 00:09:02  |    Is she aware of it?
00:09:02 - 00:09:04  |    Is it 100?
00:09:04 - 00:09:06  |    No, it was 1,500.
00:09:06 - 00:09:08  |    I don't know.
00:09:08 - 00:09:10  |    I don't know.
00:09:10 - 00:09:12  |    I don't know.
00:09:12 - 00:09:14  |    I don't know.
00:09:14 - 00:09:16  |    How many people did you think
00:09:16 - 00:09:18  |    were allowed to be with you
00:09:18 - 00:09:20  |    when you were with her?
00:09:20 - 00:09:22  |    All in all?
00:09:22 - 00:09:24  |    Well,
00:09:24 - 00:09:26  |    if it's all in all,
00:09:26 - 00:09:28  |    it's a lot.
00:09:28 - 00:09:30  |    How much do you think you can count?
00:09:30 - 00:09:32  |    Oh, it's...
00:09:32 - 00:09:34  |    How many months?
00:09:34 - 00:09:36  |    I've been with her since May 3.
00:09:36 - 00:09:38  |    Which May 3?
00:09:38 - 00:09:40  |    2019.
00:09:40 - 00:09:42  |    Until...
00:09:42 - 00:09:44  |    Yes?
00:09:44 - 00:09:46  |    I ran away around
00:09:46 - 00:09:48  |    November...
00:09:48 - 00:09:50  |    Yes, November.
00:09:50 - 00:09:52  |    Let me count.
00:09:52 - 00:09:54  |    What was November?
00:09:54 - 00:09:56  |    Which year?
00:09:56 - 00:09:58  |    2019.
00:09:58 - 00:10:00  |    Around June.
00:10:00 - 00:10:02  |    June or July.
00:10:02 - 00:10:04  |    That's when I ran away.
00:10:04 - 00:10:06  |    How many?
00:10:06 - 00:10:08  |    It was a lot.
00:10:08 - 00:10:10  |    It was thousands.
00:10:10 - 00:10:12  |    How many customers?
00:10:12 - 00:10:14  |    If you count...
00:10:14 - 00:10:16  |    How many people?
00:10:16 - 00:10:18  |    Around 100.
00:10:18 - 00:10:20  |    It was just me
00:10:20 - 00:10:22  |    or the whole shop.
00:10:22 - 00:10:24  |    Just you?
00:10:24 - 00:10:26  |    Yes, just me.
00:10:26 - 00:10:28  |    Around 500.
00:10:28 - 00:10:30  |    Around 500 people.
00:10:30 - 00:10:32  |    It's hard to count.
00:10:32 - 00:10:34  |    For example,
00:10:34 - 00:10:36  |    if it's a day,
00:10:36 - 00:10:38  |    it's like
00:10:38 - 00:10:40  |    6-7 people.
00:10:40 - 00:10:42  |    Around 5-6 people.
00:10:42 - 00:10:44  |    Every day?
00:10:44 - 00:10:46  |    Yes, every day.
00:10:46 - 00:10:48  |    She said...
00:10:48 - 00:10:50  |    It's a lot.
00:10:50 - 00:10:52  |    The whole house...
00:10:52 - 00:10:54  |    She said...
00:10:54 - 00:10:56  |    She said...
00:10:56 - 00:10:58  |    She was there...
00:10:58 - 00:11:00  |    She was going to count
00:11:00 - 00:11:02  |    in April 2019.
00:11:02 - 00:11:04  |    And then
00:11:04 - 00:11:06  |    she ran away.
00:11:06 - 00:11:08  |    It's about
00:11:08 - 00:11:10  |    6-7 people a day.
00:11:10 - 00:11:12  |    Every day.
00:11:12 - 00:11:14  |    Sometimes.
00:11:14 - 00:11:16  |    Sometimes.
00:11:16 - 00:11:18  |    I don't know.
00:11:18 - 00:11:20  |    She said...
00:11:20 - 00:11:22  |    It's about 500.
00:11:22 - 00:11:24  |    If you count it as a day,
00:11:24 - 00:11:26  |    I can't remember.
00:11:26 - 00:11:28  |    But if it's a day,
00:11:28 - 00:11:30  |    I know the number.
00:11:30 - 00:11:32  |    How many days?
00:11:32 - 00:11:34  |    How many months?
00:11:34 - 00:11:36  |    She said...
00:11:36 - 00:11:38  |    For two months.
00:11:38 - 00:11:40  |    She was there in April and May.
00:11:40 - 00:11:42  |    If we count it as a day,
00:11:42 - 00:11:44  |    it's about 6-7 people a day.
00:11:44 - 00:11:46  |    And...
00:11:46 - 00:11:48  |    It changes
00:11:48 - 00:11:50  |    for people.
00:11:50 - 00:11:52  |    For example,
00:11:52 - 00:11:54  |    there are 3-2 girls
00:11:54 - 00:11:56  |    in the shop.
00:11:56 - 00:11:58  |    It changes every day.
00:11:58 - 00:12:00  |    There are a lot of customers.
00:12:00 - 00:12:02  |    Why does it change?
00:12:02 - 00:12:04  |    Because
00:12:04 - 00:12:06  |    everyone has to switch.
00:12:06 - 00:12:08  |    Yes.
00:12:08 - 00:12:10  |    Everyone has a tag.
00:12:10 - 00:12:12  |    There are
00:12:12 - 00:12:14  |    2-3 girls
00:12:14 - 00:12:16  |    in the shop.
00:12:16 - 00:12:18  |    And they were going to ask
00:12:18 - 00:12:20  |    if they were going to ask for a wine
00:12:20 - 00:12:22  |    or a knife.
00:12:22 - 00:12:24  |    So everyone could
00:12:24 - 00:12:26  |    have a pen.
00:12:26 - 00:12:28  |    So everyone
00:12:28 - 00:12:30  |    could have a tag.
00:12:30 - 00:12:32  |    Yes.
00:12:32 - 00:12:34  |    Are you afraid
00:12:34 - 00:12:36  |    that someone else
00:12:36 - 00:12:38  |    has earned so much money from your misfortune?
00:12:38 - 00:12:40  |    Do you feel very angry
00:12:40 - 00:12:42  |    that someone else
00:12:42 - 00:12:44  |    comes to make money from you?
00:12:44 - 00:12:46  |    No.
00:12:46 - 00:12:48  |    I'm angry.
00:12:48 - 00:12:50  |    To be honest,
00:12:50 - 00:12:52  |    I'm very stupid.
00:12:52 - 00:12:54  |    I'm stupid
00:12:54 - 00:12:56  |    in many ways.
00:12:56 - 00:12:58  |    I'm angry
00:12:58 - 00:13:00  |    when someone
00:13:00 - 00:13:02  |    does something like this.
00:13:02 - 00:13:04  |    When I'm in Denmark,
00:13:04 - 00:13:06  |    I know many things
00:13:06 - 00:13:08  |    that
00:13:08 - 00:13:10  |    they
00:13:10 - 00:13:12  |    eat from
00:13:12 - 00:13:14  |    other people's dreams
00:13:14 - 00:13:16  |    that
00:13:16 - 00:13:18  |    everyone wants to have a better life.
00:13:18 - 00:13:20  |    They can take care of their family.
00:13:20 - 00:13:22  |    But they eat from
00:13:22 - 00:13:24  |    here.
00:13:24 - 00:13:26  |    It's like
00:13:26 - 00:13:28  |    they're selling their dreams.
00:13:28 - 00:13:30  |    Although
00:13:30 - 00:13:32  |    they can do it themselves.
00:13:32 - 00:13:34  |    Although they say
00:13:34 - 00:13:36  |    that they're very professional.
00:13:36 - 00:13:38  |    But
00:13:38 - 00:13:40  |    it's like
00:13:40 - 00:13:42  |    it's
00:13:42 - 00:13:44  |    bad.
00:13:44 - 00:13:46  |    Do you feel pressured?
00:13:46 - 00:13:48  |    Yes.
00:13:50 - 00:13:52  |    Do you feel
00:13:52 - 00:13:54  |    bad?
00:13:54 - 00:13:56  |    Yes, I feel bad.
00:13:56 - 00:13:58  |    I feel bad
00:13:58 - 00:14:00  |    because
00:14:00 - 00:14:02  |    I'm the only one
00:14:02 - 00:14:04  |    who's
00:14:04 - 00:14:06  |    in Denmark.
00:14:06 - 00:14:08  |    I'm in Denmark
00:14:08 - 00:14:10  |    for a long time.
00:14:10 - 00:14:12  |    I'm in Denmark
00:14:12 - 00:14:14  |    for a long time.
00:14:14 - 00:14:16  |    I'm in Denmark
00:14:16 - 00:14:18  |    for a long time.
00:14:18 - 00:14:20  |    I'm in Denmark
00:14:20 - 00:14:22  |    for a long time.
00:14:22 - 00:14:26  |    Her dream is to get a better life.
00:14:28 - 00:14:32  |    She can send work and earn her own money.
00:14:33 - 00:14:36  |    When she tells that she is so professional and knows a lot of people,
00:14:37 - 00:14:43  |    why can't she use her sexuality to earn money?
00:14:43 - 00:14:51  |    She is afraid.

00:00:00 - 00:00:06  |    There was some kind of explosion. It wasn't too loud. I thought it was strange, but it wasn't like that.
00:00:06 - 00:00:11  |    And then I went out into the yard, looked at the whole yard in the smoke, people were screaming,
00:00:11 - 00:00:34  |    covered faces, children were screaming, I was shocked.

00:00:00 - 00:00:03  |    It's going to be a bit of a collapse.
00:00:06 - 00:00:08  |    Now I don't have...
00:00:09 - 00:00:10  |    Well...
00:00:10 - 00:00:32  |    Here, the first take.
00:00:40 - 00:00:45  |    We are investigating about special military forces and stuff like that.
00:00:46 - 00:00:52  |    It's really difficult for us to talk about and talk to the sources.
00:00:53 - 00:00:55  |    Why is it so difficult?
00:00:55 - 00:01:11  |    So thank you for agreeing to meet with us. We have a problem that there is a lot of mystery around this and the sources we contact with don't want to talk. Why is it so difficult?
00:01:11 - 00:01:34  |    Mystery is a rather difficult word. It's rather a secret service, a conviction about what there is no such thing today, the so-called esprit de corps, proper behaviour, preparation of people and elitism. That's the most important thing.
00:01:34 - 00:01:43  |    So secrecy may be not the right word, but it's more about the secret related to your service, to your job.
00:01:44 - 00:01:46  |    Esprit de corps.
00:01:47 - 00:02:00  |    Esprit de corps, which means that you have an order and you keep this... and also this is some kind of feeling that you belong to the elite.
00:02:00 - 00:02:19  |    But then how do you... how does anyone get to learn or get to understand or get an idea of what jobs and what kind of assignments that the special military forces in countries like Poland have if they can never talk about it?
00:02:19 - 00:02:29  |    How do you get to know how such special units functioned in the past, since the sources are silent on this topic?
00:02:30 - 00:02:47  |    The source is a person, a person, but the sources are also archival materials. The sources can also be memories. As I have shown, this is the book of the first commander of the special group of platoon of divers and later of the Formos.
00:02:47 - 00:02:56  |    So your source can be a person, but as well it can be a document for example and also sometimes the memoirs.
00:02:57 - 00:03:07  |    So the book that I am having with me was written by the person who set up this elite Formosa unit actually.
00:03:07 - 00:03:26  |    Ok. We have something we would like to get to know more about when we are here in Poland. We need to talk to a person that we think has a history as a special force, a diver here in Poland.
00:03:27 - 00:03:34  |    When we are meeting with this guy, how do you think we can get any information out of him and his past?
00:03:34 - 00:03:42  |    We have located the source of this case in Poland.
00:03:43 - 00:03:48  |    According to the scenario, they will meet with this person tomorrow, so after the conversation with you.
00:03:49 - 00:03:55  |    So we will meet with a person that we have information that she was in such an elite unit of divers.
00:03:56 - 00:04:02  |    We will meet with him, he agreed to meet, but the question is how should we talk to him to make him tell us something?
00:04:02 - 00:04:08  |    First of all, in what period was he? This is important.
00:04:09 - 00:04:16  |    If it was the 70s, 80s, 20th century, then it will be easier to talk, apparently.
00:04:17 - 00:04:20  |    But we need to remember that there were few of these people.
00:04:21 - 00:04:22  |    Elite to elite, I will repeat it again.
00:04:23 - 00:04:30  |    It was a group that was formed 20 years earlier than the most famous Polish unit, GROM.
00:04:30 - 00:04:38  |    So the first question is when he was in this unit, when he was active.
00:04:39 - 00:04:45  |    If it was the 70s, 80s of the 20th century, then it may be slightly easier.
00:04:46 - 00:04:53  |    But again, I would like to remind you that this unit was probably the best of the best people they were.
00:04:53 - 00:04:59  |    And they were active 20 years before the GROM unit,
00:05:00 - 00:05:06  |    which is the most famous Polish special unit that is worldwide actually known.
00:05:07 - 00:05:08  |    So, yes.
00:05:09 - 00:05:10  |    Ok.
00:05:13 - 00:05:14  |    Do you have a new one?
00:05:15 - 00:05:16  |    Yes, I have two.
00:05:17 - 00:05:18  |    Ok.
00:05:18 - 00:05:22  |    Just a minute, sorry, I need to get this one.
00:05:25 - 00:05:31  |    You can ask about how he got into this unit, what was the recruitment process like.
00:05:32 - 00:05:37  |    You can ask about equipment, training, mutual relations between colleagues,
00:05:38 - 00:05:41  |    because there is no such thing, for example, in orders, in some documents.
00:05:42 - 00:05:46  |    And here loyalty, cooperation, trust is important.
00:05:46 - 00:05:52  |    This is really a group of specialized combat divers or special forces,
00:05:53 - 00:05:58  |    where mutual loyalty and trust is one of the basics of functioning.
00:05:59 - 00:06:02  |    Trust, I trust you, you will not leave me.
00:06:03 - 00:06:04  |    You can trust me too.
00:06:06 - 00:06:07  |    This is very important.
00:06:08 - 00:06:10  |    There are some questions you could probably ask such person,
00:06:11 - 00:06:13  |    like a question about how he got into the unit,
00:06:13 - 00:06:18  |    how the training went, what equipment they used,
00:06:19 - 00:06:25  |    because this is outside the orders, this information could be probably revealed.
00:06:26 - 00:06:31  |    But again, what's the most important in this unit and between the unit members
00:06:32 - 00:06:33  |    was the loyalty and trust.
00:06:34 - 00:06:39  |    So it is like, I can trust you and you will never leave me or betray me,
00:06:40 - 00:06:41  |    and you can trust me and I will not betray you.
00:06:41 - 00:06:46  |    So there is this thing between them that they trust each other
00:06:47 - 00:06:48  |    and they don't speak about it.
00:06:50 - 00:06:56  |    And it's pretty cool, this feeling that they don't really can disclose anything.
00:06:57 - 00:07:03  |    Does it continue for the rest of their lives or are there any specific kind of year
00:07:04 - 00:07:07  |    where they say, now I can talk freely?
00:07:07 - 00:07:10  |    Does this feeling of loyalty ever go away?
00:07:11 - 00:07:13  |    Can they start talking about it after so many years
00:07:14 - 00:07:16  |    or is it for the rest of their lives, what do you think?
00:07:17 - 00:07:19  |    These are people who stick together.
00:07:20 - 00:07:25  |    They work together more than once, they contact each other.
00:07:26 - 00:07:27  |    It goes away.
00:07:28 - 00:07:30  |    Human life is very, very difficult.
00:07:31 - 00:07:34  |    But if they worked together in this kind of activities,
00:07:34 - 00:07:36  |    in this kind of army, in this kind of formation,
00:07:37 - 00:07:38  |    I think it will never go away.
00:07:39 - 00:07:42  |    Many people don't use their name,
00:07:43 - 00:07:47  |    but they use some kind of pseudonym, let's say a nickname here.
00:07:47 - 00:08:03  |    And then they really get to know each other.
00:08:17 - 00:08:23  |    But no, very often they don't use even their names,
00:08:24 - 00:08:28  |    just some alias, for example, as I understand among themselves.
00:08:32 - 00:08:37  |    But this loyalty to each other is something I respect and I understand it,
00:08:38 - 00:08:45  |    but can we risk meeting someone and asking about his past in the military
00:08:45 - 00:08:48  |    and he will just straight up maybe lie and tell us,
00:08:49 - 00:08:50  |    no, I was never in the military
00:08:50 - 00:09:16  |    and just say that it's not his history even though we might think it is?
00:09:16 - 00:09:19  |    I can always say that I don't remember.
00:09:20 - 00:09:24  |    When it comes to the first set up for the special platoon,
00:09:25 - 00:09:29  |    you have to remember that there were professional soldiers there,
00:09:30 - 00:09:32  |    but there were also soldiers from the platoon.
00:09:33 - 00:09:35  |    So this platoon group, for example,
00:09:36 - 00:09:38  |    didn't even have any recognisable marks,
00:09:39 - 00:09:41  |    even on the caps, on the ribbon,
00:09:41 - 00:09:45  |    it had the name of a hydrographic circle, which means a complete mess,
00:09:45 - 00:10:12  |    a complete mystery, as I said, I don't remember.
00:10:12 - 00:10:15  |    They were private.
00:10:16 - 00:10:19  |    Some of them were taken from the army,
00:10:20 - 00:10:23  |    but part of them were private, like there were recruits taken from...
00:10:24 - 00:10:25  |    Mercenaries.
00:10:26 - 00:10:27  |    No, mercenaries is not the right word.
00:10:28 - 00:10:31  |    But they were like, voluntarily they came to the unit.
00:10:32 - 00:10:35  |    And on their uniforms, they had no names,
00:10:36 - 00:10:38  |    they had no indication what unit they are from, nothing.
00:10:38 - 00:10:41  |    So they were like blank, you know.
00:10:42 - 00:11:01  |    Are there any specific words or phrases that we should be aware of,
00:11:02 - 00:11:03  |    we should listen after?
00:11:03 - 00:11:09  |    Are there any specific words or phrases that we should be aware of,
00:11:10 - 00:11:11  |    when talking to such a person?
00:11:12 - 00:11:13  |    It is...
00:11:14 - 00:11:15  |    I'll put it this way,
00:11:16 - 00:11:19  |    if he wants to speak, he will say what he wants.
00:11:20 - 00:11:23  |    Not everything can always be in accordance with the actual state,
00:11:24 - 00:11:25  |    with what he actually did.
00:11:26 - 00:11:27  |    Because it is somewhere...
00:11:28 - 00:11:31  |    I would also call it self-censorship.
00:11:31 - 00:11:34  |    People were brought up in a different time, in a different era,
00:11:35 - 00:11:37  |    where the problem of keeping secrets was really,
00:11:38 - 00:11:41  |    when it comes to elite units, was very, very overlooked.
00:11:42 - 00:11:45  |    Anyway, everyone leaving the army signed a document,
00:11:46 - 00:11:49  |    they are obliged to keep secrets about what I did.
00:11:50 - 00:11:57  |    Well, it's like this, that if he wants to speak to you,
00:11:57 - 00:12:02  |    he will speak, and whatever he says, he wants to say it.
00:12:03 - 00:12:08  |    So you have to remember that those people are under very strict auto-censorship.
00:12:09 - 00:12:11  |    They know exactly what to say, what they can.
00:12:12 - 00:12:15  |    Sometimes they can tell you something, but that's not going to be true.
00:12:16 - 00:12:19  |    You have to remember that back then it was a completely different system,
00:12:20 - 00:12:24  |    and keeping this secret was treated completely differently than nowadays.
00:12:24 - 00:12:27  |    And the very important thing is that when they were leaving the army,
00:12:28 - 00:12:31  |    they had to sign the paper that they are keeping the secrets,
00:12:32 - 00:12:33  |    and they will never reveal it.
00:12:34 - 00:12:38  |    I worry that if we meet someone we want to talk to,
00:12:39 - 00:12:42  |    and we want to learn about his history, that we can't gain his trust,
00:12:43 - 00:12:45  |    that we can't get him to trust us with his story,
00:12:46 - 00:12:50  |    and open up to us about what his history with the military is.
00:12:50 - 00:12:55  |    Do you think that's going to happen to us, that they won't trust us with their story?
00:12:56 - 00:12:59  |    I'm afraid that we are a TV crew,
00:13:00 - 00:13:04  |    that we have cameras and that these people won't open up to us,
00:13:05 - 00:13:11  |    in front of the cameras, taking part in a TV show.
00:13:12 - 00:13:16  |    It may be, of course, but please understand the situation
00:13:16 - 00:13:20  |    in which we are right now, the rest of Europe, the rest of the world.
00:13:20 - 00:13:49  |    What is the guarantee that you are who you are?
00:13:50 - 00:13:57  |    The current political themes are also working against us, maybe, right now.
00:13:58 - 00:14:02  |    So the current political situation is also taking advantage of us, in a way?
00:14:03 - 00:14:10  |    Yes, please remember that they were soldiers specialised in combat.
00:14:11 - 00:14:16  |    The mission of such a soldier is not to say to kill, but to fight.
00:14:16 - 00:14:22  |    At that time, we belonged to two different political and military pacts.
00:14:23 - 00:14:29  |    After a few years, the alliances turned around, everything changed,
00:14:30 - 00:14:36  |    the world of the two-way world fell apart, and now something deep in our memory
00:14:37 - 00:14:40  |    may still function in the future.
00:14:40 - 00:14:46  |    It can play against you, because those people were trained,
00:14:47 - 00:14:51  |    there were soldiers trained to, I don't want to use the word kill,
00:14:52 - 00:14:54  |    but to be in combat, to fight.
00:14:55 - 00:14:59  |    Back then, in the past, we belonged to two different systems,
00:15:00 - 00:15:02  |    very strong systems, we were enemies.
00:15:03 - 00:15:07  |    After dozens of years, it changed, right now we are in the same pact,
00:15:07 - 00:15:13  |    the same system, but maybe the previous situation is still in their heads.
00:15:14 - 00:15:18  |    Maybe they still remember that we were enemies in the past.
00:15:18 - 00:15:37  |    The whole TV series that we are making here is about whether there were Polish troops on the island Bornholm.
00:15:37 - 00:15:47  |    Do you think that if we meet a special forces soldier that was on Bornholm,
00:15:48 - 00:15:53  |    do you think that he will tell us, or do you think that he will say that he doesn't know?
00:15:54 - 00:16:01  |    Our history is concentrated around Polish soldiers who were on the island Bornholm.
00:16:01 - 00:16:06  |    Now the question is, if we meet a person who was on this island, will he confess to it?
00:16:07 - 00:16:12  |    But I will say this, Polish soldiers were on Bornholm several times,
00:16:13 - 00:16:16  |    taking into account the escape of the airmen, they were physically there,
00:16:17 - 00:16:20  |    those who took place in the 50s and later.
00:16:21 - 00:16:25  |    However, when it comes to covert actions, maybe I will say something, maybe not.
00:16:26 - 00:16:28  |    Bornholm is only one of the elements.
00:16:28 - 00:16:32  |    The important ones are the Danube straits, the Jutland Peninsula.
00:16:33 - 00:16:37  |    Where there was a possible descent in the case of the next war,
00:16:37 - 00:16:58  |    such diversionary actions were to be carried out with the participation of special divers.
00:17:07 - 00:17:09  |    One second, I will check.
00:17:10 - 00:17:12  |    No, I will check.
00:17:13 - 00:17:14  |    Islands?
00:17:15 - 00:17:16  |    No, no, no.
00:17:17 - 00:17:18  |    One second.
00:17:19 - 00:17:20  |    Yes.
00:17:21 - 00:17:22  |    Straits.
00:17:23 - 00:17:24  |    Yes, straits.
00:17:25 - 00:17:26  |    More important.
00:17:27 - 00:17:35  |    And so if this person took a part in such training, he may speak about this, he may not.
00:17:35 - 00:17:43  |    But remember that there were like in the plans of attacks,
00:17:44 - 00:17:54  |    this unit, the diver unit was supposed to be used as a recon,
00:17:55 - 00:17:59  |    like they were supposed to get first to make a sabotage, to make a recon,
00:18:00 - 00:18:01  |    and then the others would come.
00:18:02 - 00:18:03  |    All right.
00:18:03 - 00:18:08  |    So what got our investigation started was this myth we heard,
00:18:09 - 00:18:13  |    and the reason we came to Poland is because we heard this myth that
00:18:14 - 00:18:20  |    Polish special force divers in maybe the 70s or the 80s,
00:18:21 - 00:18:24  |    as part of their training or maybe as part of their exam,
00:18:25 - 00:18:30  |    they would swim to Bornholm and they would steal a brick from Hammershus,
00:18:30 - 00:18:36  |    a historical place, and then they would go back to Poland with that brick
00:18:37 - 00:18:38  |    and show that they've been to Bornholm.
00:18:39 - 00:18:40  |    Have you heard that before?
00:18:41 - 00:18:47  |    Our starting point is the story or the myth we heard about
00:18:48 - 00:18:53  |    that part of their training or maybe the final exam was that they were supposed to get to Bornholm,
00:18:54 - 00:18:58  |    steal that stone or brick from a historical place and come back and show that they had it.
00:18:58 - 00:19:01  |    Have you ever heard of that kind of training?
00:19:02 - 00:19:05  |    I haven't heard of anything like that.
00:19:06 - 00:19:10  |    However, I won't say that it's impossible, that it's a fairy tale, that it's a myth,
00:19:11 - 00:19:16  |    because we have to remember that these people somehow had to get to this island.
00:19:17 - 00:19:24  |    And now, if the Polish special forces divers could land from underwater angles,
00:19:24 - 00:19:29  |    that is, through torpedo hatches, because they were going through that kind of training,
00:19:30 - 00:19:32  |    and maybe some kind of underwater angle would come up,
00:19:33 - 00:19:37  |    they would land this kind of a combat pair, a section,
00:19:38 - 00:19:41  |    they would have some task to perform and they would do that task.
00:19:42 - 00:19:47  |    It was predicted that there would be vehicles that would transport,
00:19:47 - 00:19:54  |    it's a vehicle called a muddler, a bird that would transport one dive plate,
00:19:55 - 00:20:02  |    the rest would be carried somewhere by them, through these vehicles.
00:20:03 - 00:20:09  |    Well, those were tasks that are not fully explained to this day,
00:20:10 - 00:20:15  |    so I think that it would be necessary to penetrate the act, the materials.
00:20:15 - 00:20:20  |    So, I've never heard about this, I can't say this is like a fable,
00:20:21 - 00:20:23  |    this is not true, I can't say this is true, because I don't know.
00:20:24 - 00:20:28  |    The question you would have to ask yourself is what would be their starting point,
00:20:29 - 00:20:31  |    but it may be like the submarine.
00:20:32 - 00:20:37  |    We know that they were trained to move via the torpedo bay out,
00:20:37 - 00:20:44  |    so it's possible that the submarine would come closer to Bornholm,
00:20:45 - 00:20:46  |    they would go and come back.
00:20:47 - 00:20:50  |    We know also that there were plans, there were whole plans,
00:20:51 - 00:20:57  |    how they would get, how they would start this descent, this action,
00:20:58 - 00:21:01  |    that there was some kind of equipment that they would go on,
00:21:02 - 00:21:04  |    and then the others would follow them.
00:21:04 - 00:21:10  |    But we know that there are still a lot of exercises or trainings
00:21:11 - 00:21:16  |    that we don't know the nature of, because not everything has been examined yet,
00:21:17 - 00:21:21  |    so to find out if that was true or not, I would suggest that you should go
00:21:22 - 00:21:28  |    and find the files of this unit, and find the files describing such exercises.
00:21:29 - 00:21:32  |    Where do we find those files?
00:21:32 - 00:21:34  |    Where would you tell us to start looking for those files,
00:21:35 - 00:21:36  |    if we want to know more about this?
00:21:37 - 00:21:39  |    Where could we find such documents?
00:21:40 - 00:21:44  |    The military archives, because in general any kind of material
00:21:45 - 00:21:49  |    related to the activities of the Polish army here in the communist period,
00:21:50 - 00:21:52  |    because we are talking about the period until 1989,
00:21:53 - 00:21:55  |    then Warsaw, the Central Military Archives.
00:21:56 - 00:21:58  |    That would be the Central Military Archives in Warsaw.
00:21:58 - 00:22:05  |    We are speaking about the information about the military before 1989,
00:22:06 - 00:22:08  |    so everything is there.
00:22:09 - 00:22:12  |    I thought everything would be kept secret.
00:22:13 - 00:22:17  |    The question is if those files would be revealed to you.
00:22:18 - 00:22:25  |    Do you think we could get access to those files if we wrote them a nice e-mail?
00:22:25 - 00:22:28  |    Let me put it this way.
00:22:29 - 00:22:34  |    You can try to contact the Central Military Archives,
00:22:35 - 00:22:40  |    to see if they have such documents and if they will be available for the film.
00:22:41 - 00:22:47  |    I would say you should try and ask them if they would show you the files
00:22:48 - 00:22:51  |    for this specific purpose of filming the documentary.
00:22:51 - 00:22:54  |    Okay.
00:22:55 - 00:22:56  |    It's very, very nice.
00:22:57 - 00:22:58  |    It's very nice, right?
00:22:59 - 00:23:00  |    Very nice.
00:23:01 - 00:23:03  |    I'm almost happy.
00:23:04 - 00:23:06  |    I would like to share something with you.
00:23:07 - 00:23:09  |    If you could think of something,
00:23:10 - 00:23:14  |    then it would be nice if you could give us a little bit of your opinion.
00:23:15 - 00:23:17  |    I would like to thank you.
00:23:17 - 00:23:20  |    Thank you.
00:23:22 - 00:23:24  |    For example, a whole set of books.
00:23:25 - 00:23:27  |    I don't have more questions.
00:23:28 - 00:23:29  |    How should we analyze it?
00:23:30 - 00:23:31  |    Should we ask questions?
00:23:32 - 00:23:35  |    Sometimes we tell each other if we can.
00:23:36 - 00:23:38  |    We can imagine that it might happen.
00:23:39 - 00:23:40  |    Sounds like you are trying to figure it out.
00:23:41 - 00:23:43  |    Let's hope we can just cut to the end.
00:23:44 - 00:23:45  |    Do you want to take it?
00:23:45 - 00:23:46  |    You can take it.
00:23:51 - 00:23:52  |    I can take it.
00:23:53 - 00:23:54  |    You can take it.
00:24:01 - 00:24:02  |    Ready?
00:24:03 - 00:24:04  |    Ready.
00:24:05 - 00:24:08  |    So Peter and I have talked a lot about that.
00:24:09 - 00:24:12  |    If you can think it, it must have happened.
00:24:12 - 00:24:16  |    And also some of the sources that we have spoken to
00:24:17 - 00:24:21  |    also imply that it probably happened.
00:24:22 - 00:24:24  |    What do you think about that?
00:24:25 - 00:24:26  |    You mean the brick story?
00:24:27 - 00:24:28  |    Yes.
00:24:29 - 00:24:32  |    So we talked and we came to the conclusion
00:24:33 - 00:24:35  |    that if such a story was invented,
00:24:36 - 00:24:38  |    it probably happened.
00:24:38 - 00:24:41  |    And we also have some sources in Denmark
00:24:42 - 00:24:44  |    that actually told us that story.
00:24:45 - 00:24:46  |    So I would like to ask you again
00:24:47 - 00:24:48  |    how do you hear such a story?
00:24:49 - 00:24:50  |    What do you think?
00:24:51 - 00:24:54  |    I have heard many different stories.
00:24:55 - 00:24:57  |    After years, everyone can tell everything.
00:24:58 - 00:25:02  |    However, everything requires verification.
00:25:03 - 00:25:06  |    Especially when it comes to special forces soldiers.
00:25:06 - 00:25:10  |    As I said, after years, after 30, 40 years,
00:25:11 - 00:25:13  |    from a given event,
00:25:14 - 00:25:18  |    each of us could fulfill some great function in the army.
00:25:19 - 00:25:22  |    To be an extremely important person.
00:25:23 - 00:25:26  |    And in fact, only he knows what he was doing.
00:25:31 - 00:25:32  |    Once more?
00:25:32 - 00:25:35  |    Once more?
00:25:36 - 00:25:37  |    The whole thing?
00:25:38 - 00:25:39  |    No, just the end of it.
00:25:40 - 00:25:42  |    Could you repeat the ending?
00:25:43 - 00:25:44  |    Yes, please.
00:25:45 - 00:25:49  |    After many years, after 30, 40 years, we can say everything.
00:25:50 - 00:25:51  |    We can invent everything.
00:25:52 - 00:25:54  |    We are not able to do it any other way.
00:25:55 - 00:25:57  |    Not everyone is able to verify it.
00:25:58 - 00:26:00  |    So we assume that certain events could take place,
00:26:00 - 00:26:02  |    and Kszanin was simply discolored.
00:26:03 - 00:26:05  |    Well, I've heard many stories.
00:26:08 - 00:26:12  |    So to tell you if there is truth or not,
00:26:13 - 00:26:15  |    you have to verify with the files.
00:26:16 - 00:26:19  |    The stories are about special forces.
00:26:20 - 00:26:24  |    And they are supposed to happen 30, 40 years ago.
00:26:25 - 00:26:27  |    And anybody can tell you anything about the past.
00:26:27 - 00:26:33  |    Anybody can tell you that in the past he was very high rank in the army.
00:26:34 - 00:26:37  |    But you would have to verify it actually to know it's true.
00:26:38 - 00:26:40  |    So the challenge is to verify the story.
00:26:41 - 00:26:42  |    Exactly.
00:26:43 - 00:26:47  |    A historian and every researcher of the past, especially of the army,
00:26:48 - 00:26:50  |    should not rely on any statements,
00:26:51 - 00:26:53  |    but on verified materials.
00:26:53 - 00:26:56  |    But verification has to be multi-stage, multi-level.
00:26:57 - 00:26:58  |    Exactly, yes.
00:26:59 - 00:27:00  |    So you are a historian,
00:27:01 - 00:27:04  |    and especially we are talking about military special forces.
00:27:05 - 00:27:07  |    You should not base on hearsays,
00:27:08 - 00:27:12  |    but rather verify it with the documents and files.
00:27:13 - 00:27:14  |    Spoken like a true historian.
00:27:15 - 00:27:16  |    Exactly.
00:27:17 - 00:27:18  |    You speak like a true historian.
00:27:18 - 00:27:22  |    Oh yes, because I am a historian.
00:27:22 - 00:27:47  |    Thank you so much for this part.

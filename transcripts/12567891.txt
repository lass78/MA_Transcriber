00:00:00 - 00:00:15  |    I hope that this answer from the Germans will come this time quickly,
00:00:15 - 00:00:22  |    because the Germans are dragging the key, they are acting in a difficult way to understand.
00:00:22 - 00:00:29  |    We can see very clearly that they do not want to help defending Ukraine in the wider range,
00:00:29 - 00:00:38  |    what it means, whether it means fear, whether it means some incomprehensible fear,
00:00:38 - 00:00:45  |    whether the belief that the return to normal relations with Russia is still possible.
00:00:45 - 00:00:50  |    It is worth asking a few such questions, because for the good of the situation,
00:00:50 - 00:00:57  |    this coalition of countries that want to help Ukraine repel barbaric aggression, Russian aggression,
00:00:57 - 00:01:04  |    has to expand. The Germans are the largest country and they should, to a great extent,
00:01:04 - 00:01:09  |    join this common coalition of countries that help Ukraine.
00:01:09 - 00:01:13  |    We have directed this proposal, we are looking forward to a quick response.
00:01:13 - 00:01:20  |    We are already training Ukrainian soldiers in Poland,
00:01:20 - 00:01:29  |    other countries are also doing this in their territories, so it is nothing new here and we will continue it.
00:01:29 - 00:01:32  |    Does the government consider such a possibility, such a step?
00:01:32 - 00:01:34  |    However, I have a question for the ministers.
00:01:34 - 00:01:38  |    Of course, we will also address the return of costs here to the European Union.
00:01:38 - 00:01:42  |    It will be another test of the European Union's good will.
00:01:42 - 00:01:45  |    The European Union should compensate us for these costs.
00:01:45 - 00:01:46  |    I hope that this will happen.
00:01:46 - 00:01:48  |    Thank you very much.
00:01:48 - 00:01:51  |    Thank you very much.

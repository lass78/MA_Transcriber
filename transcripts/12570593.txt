00:10:00 - 00:10:06  |    The Poles were impatient and said, we are no longer waiting for the decision of Scholz.
00:10:06 - 00:10:13  |    Isn't the loss of trust in the end greater and more sustainable than you want it to be now?
00:10:13 - 00:10:16  |    No, it doesn't exist either. I want to say that explicitly.
00:10:16 - 00:10:21  |    Everyone knows that we make the greatest contribution, also in comparison to many others,
00:10:21 - 00:10:25  |    which now concerns the support of Ukraine, not only financially and humanely,
00:10:25 - 00:10:27  |    but also when it comes to weapons supply.
00:10:27 - 00:10:33  |    But everyone knows that we don't do this as someone who goes alone, but together with everyone else.
00:10:33 - 00:10:37  |    Then all the criticism we've heard was basically just theater?
00:10:37 - 00:10:42  |    I think you have to make yourself very clear that there are many allies from Germany in Europe
00:10:42 - 00:10:46  |    and in the transatlantic alliance in the G7 around the world.
00:10:46 - 00:10:49  |    And they all understand that very, very well.
00:10:49 - 00:10:55  |    And it wouldn't be possible to develop such coordinated approaches again and again
00:10:55 - 00:10:59  |    if it weren't for the principle of cooperation with others.
00:10:59 - 00:11:05  |    I want to say very clearly that from my point of view, the citizens want to know
00:11:05 - 00:11:10  |    whether they can rely on those who rule, whether they can maintain pressure.
00:11:10 - 00:11:14  |    If you deliver tanks, you should never do this for internal political motives,
00:11:14 - 00:11:19  |    but because it is right in terms of the support, in this case Ukraine,
00:11:19 - 00:11:26  |    which is attacked by Russia and where Russia wants to conquer the whole country or part of the country,
00:11:26 - 00:11:31  |    but also in view of the decisions we make for our own security.
00:11:31 - 00:11:38  |    And that only works if you have strong nerves and know that you have to bring this forward with others.
00:11:38 - 00:11:42  |    Nevertheless, many allies have the word Scholzing in their mouths.
00:11:42 - 00:11:47  |    A British historian came up with this and it means as much as promises of support.
00:11:47 - 00:11:50  |    And then you delay it.
00:11:50 - 00:11:54  |    About the 40 claimed Marder rifle tanks,
00:11:54 - 00:11:57  |    Germany has been discussing this since last summer.
00:11:57 - 00:11:59  |    They are still not delivered.
00:11:59 - 00:12:02  |    Why do you think that the Leopard tanks will work better now?
00:12:02 - 00:12:06  |    First of all, that's what we've done most of the time.
00:12:06 - 00:12:11  |    I mean, you can look around and you've certainly documented it.
00:12:11 - 00:12:17  |    With all the excitement about everything that has been discussed, one or the other is out of sight.
00:12:17 - 00:12:19  |    But I would like to repeat it again.
00:12:19 - 00:12:22  |    Germany is the country that is at the forefront.
00:12:22 - 00:12:24  |    Mr. Bundeskanzler, that's true.
00:12:24 - 00:12:26  |    And also in the real deliveries.
00:12:26 - 00:12:33  |    That's why it's so amazing that you allow yourself to get a different impression.
00:12:33 - 00:12:38  |    In fact, some people are hiding a bit in the background and say, let's say...
00:12:38 - 00:12:42  |    Look at the citizens who are very interested in this.
00:12:42 - 00:12:45  |    There is no other way of doing things that is reasonable.
00:12:45 - 00:12:49  |    That people shout loudly, that you constantly get someone in your broadcast
00:12:49 - 00:12:54  |    who says very immediately with a serious face and this and that and I don't understand that.
00:12:54 - 00:12:58  |    You can offer 300 of them every day and then document that.
00:12:58 - 00:13:03  |    But the citizens want someone to rule, who is not impressed by it,
00:13:03 - 00:13:10  |    but the course that is responsible for our country, also for the security of peace in Europe
00:13:10 - 00:13:13  |    and also for our own security.
00:13:13 - 00:13:18  |    And that means that we act in accordance with others and that we do it.
00:13:18 - 00:13:24  |    And as I said, the translation by Scholzing is, Germany does the most.
00:13:24 - 00:13:26  |    New translation.
00:13:26 - 00:13:28  |    We have to ask the Leopards again.
00:13:28 - 00:13:33  |    You are now promising two battalions, that would be about 90 pieces.
00:13:33 - 00:13:36  |    Of which 14 a company from the armed forces of the Bundeswehr.
00:13:36 - 00:13:41  |    Ukraine says, but already now, it needs hundreds of battle tanks
00:13:41 - 00:13:45  |    to fight against an expected spring offensive of the Russian army
00:13:45 - 00:13:47  |    and possibly also to put through.
00:13:47 - 00:13:53  |    Isn't it already foreseeable that what you have announced today is not enough at all?
00:13:53 - 00:14:00  |    We will negotiate with others, put together two big units and cooperate with many European allies.
00:14:00 - 00:14:02  |    That was always the wish.
00:14:02 - 00:14:06  |    And in order for this to work, we will do many things that are the urgent prerequisite.
00:14:06 - 00:14:12  |    Organize the cooperation, make sure that there is ammunition and spare parts,
00:14:12 - 00:14:15  |    make sure that training takes place here in Germany.
00:14:15 - 00:14:21  |    And what we have decided now is what we can do ourselves from our own possibilities.
00:14:21 - 00:14:24  |    And we will continue in this line.
00:14:24 - 00:14:25  |    That is for sure.
00:14:25 - 00:14:27  |    But that will be a great effort.
00:14:27 - 00:14:32  |    And some countries will have a lot of effort to make their promised contribution,
00:14:32 - 00:14:34  |    to make this joint effort.
00:14:34 - 00:14:36  |    And they also need our support.
00:14:36 - 00:14:39  |    Does Germany also have the effort to really deliver that?
00:14:39 - 00:14:43  |    We are always very precise in what we say specifically.
00:14:43 - 00:14:45  |    We have checked that beforehand.
00:14:45 - 00:14:51  |    Mr. Chancellor, can the Leopard 2 influence the course of the war to a certain extent?
00:14:51 - 00:14:53  |    So are they something like a game changer?
00:14:53 - 00:15:16  |    This is a terrible war that is going on with incredible losses for the citizens of Ukraine.
